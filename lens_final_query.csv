Möller; Andres Veske; Andreas Gal; Ulrich Finckh,"The presence of genetic influences on cognitive performance and brain volume is well established. However, specific genetic determinants of the variance of these quantitative traits are not yet known. Plexins act as receptors for semaphorins and are implicated in axon guidance, which is a key process in brain development. We have previously shown that plexin B3 is a highly potent stimulator of neurite outgrowth, which makes its gene PLXNB3 an intriguing candidate gene for traits related to human brain development and cerebral connectivity. We identified several polymorphisms in PLXNB3 predicting changes of amino acids (V598I, E1156D and V1596E) conserved at the corresponding positions of the orthologs in mouse and chimpanzee. PLXNB3 was genotyped in 303 healthy volunteers and 42 male patients with schizophrenia. Cognitive performance was measured with the vocabulary test (Wortschatztest (WST)), a method to estimate roughly general intelligence (g). Brain morphology was characterized by magnetic resonance imaging. Compared to subjects not carrying the modern, human-specific haplotype A, carriers of A scored higher in vocabulary test (WST) irrespective of diagnosis (P=0.0004). This effect could be observed in three independent groups (healthy males: P=0.048; schizophrenic males: P=0.034 and healthy females: P=0.037). Additionally, the haplotype A was associated with increased volume of brain white matter that in turn correlated with performance in the vocabulary test. These findings suggest that plexin B3 may influence cognitive performance, and the development of white matter in vivo in a way similar to its known stimulating effect on neurite outgrowth in vitro. These novel observations warrant further replication in independent samples.",12,2,190,194,Semaphorin; Brain morphometry; Psychology; Neuroscience; Haplotype; Human brain; Plexin; White matter; Genetics; Brain size; Candidate gene,,"Adult; Aged; Brain/cytology; Cognition/physiology; Cognition Disorders/genetics; Female; Haplotypes; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Fibers, Myelinated/physiology; Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics; Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Schizophrenia/genetics; Verbal Learning/physiology","Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules; PLXNB3 protein, human",,https://www.nature.com/articles/4001903.pdf https://www.nature.com/articles/4001903 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17033634,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.mp.4001903,17033634,10.1038/sj.mp.4001903,2092645519,,0,001-366-383-965-11X; 002-877-307-830-409; 005-231-662-446-774; 013-777-791-769-953; 014-347-548-015-939; 018-010-390-298-394; 022-205-083-957-622; 031-928-529-332-172; 036-399-219-626-811; 060-352-910-502-17X; 071-075-987-273-404; 077-491-247-181-29X; 106-272-742-008-582; 118-516-022-984-618; 120-110-455-769-771; 123-125-179-230-091; 140-740-158-486-208; 173-809-118-139-957; 179-405-978-776-080,37,true,,bronze

Objective This study examines the diagnostic value of icobrain dm for AD in routine clinical practice, including a comparison to the widely used FreeSurfer software, and investigates if combined brain volumes contribute to establish an AD diagnosis. Methods The study population included HC (n = 90), subjective cognitive decline (SCD, n = 93), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 357), and ADD (n = 280) patients. Through automated volumetric analyses of global, cortical, and subcortical brain structures on clinical brain MRI T1w (n = 820) images from a retrospective, multi-center study (REMEMBER), icobrain dm's (v.4.4.0) ability to differentiate disease stages via ROC analysis was compared to FreeSurfer (v.6.0). Stepwise backward regression models were constructed to investigate if combined brain volumes can differentiate between AD stages. Results icobrain dm outperformed FreeSurfer in processing time (15-30 min versus 9-32 h), robustness (0 versus 67 failures), and diagnostic performance for whole brain, hippocampal volumes, and lateral ventricles between HC and ADD patients. Stepwise backward regression showed improved diagnostic accuracy for pairwise group differentiations, with highest performance obtained for distinguishing HC from ADD (AUC = 0.914; Specificity 83.0%; Sensitivity 86.3%). Conclusion Automated volumetry has a diagnostic value for ADD diagnosis in routine clinical practice. Our findings indicate that combined brain volumes improve diagnostic accuracy, using real-world imaging data from a clinical setting.",83,2,623,639,Radiology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Disease; Dementia; Lateral ventricles; Cognitive decline; Cognitive impairment; Imaging data; Diagnostic accuracy; Medicine,Alzheimer’s disease; automated volumetry; biomarkers; magnetic resonance imaging; mild cognitive impairment,"Aged; Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging; Brain/pathology; Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnostic imaging; Female; Hippocampus/pathology; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/statistics & numerical data; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Retrospective Studies; Software",,,https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad210450 https://researchportal.vub.be/en/publications/diagnostic-performance-of-automated-mri-volumetry-by-icobrain-dm- https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/265325 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34334402/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/jad-210450,34334402,10.3233/jad-210450,3185306979,PMC8543261,0,004-321-055-775-544; 004-924-359-535-112; 005-060-553-066-760; 006-262-909-754-444; 011-249-895-955-898; 011-747-260-482-777; 014-149-975-075-875; 015-617-397-735-261; 016-515-098-513-668; 016-781-011-490-187; 017-497-628-434-810; 018-087-320-417-39X; 018-227-817-544-644; 020-181-387-202-919; 021-362-968-853-778; 022-162-645-067-553; 023-303-791-452-698; 026-273-791-733-355; 026-744-790-713-553; 031-818-054-450-257; 032-823-871-628-177; 033-893-224-094-869; 035-408-710-879-945; 036-728-820-380-503; 041-916-477-240-587; 044-892-968-112-294; 048-877-392-531-92X; 049-884-241-232-983; 052-690-172-487-095; 055-250-687-588-32X; 055-446-082-664-531; 062-056-213-825-201; 062-061-819-555-708; 068-611-420-090-912; 070-087-140-191-042; 070-122-665-911-904; 071-923-424-268-117; 076-882-781-773-537; 083-877-327-214-759; 084-786-871-122-084; 084-981-166-447-16X; 085-785-841-111-423; 089-660-204-640-820; 101-524-790-764-426; 105-417-084-799-754; 110-977-819-743-150; 112-094-439-891-972; 112-133-786-248-745; 139-553-776-527-709,11,true,cc-by-nc,green

Sandhya; Giri Babu Kande; T. Satya Savithri,"<jats:p>MR Brain Image Segmentation is an important step in brain image analysis. It facilitates the automatic interpretation or diagnosis that helps in surgical planning, estimating the changes in the brain’s volume for various types of tissues, and recognizing different neural disorders. Many neurological disorders like epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, tumor, and cancer can be effectively quantified and analyzed by finding the volume of the brain tissues such as White Matter (WM), Gray Matter (GM), and Cerebro Spinal Fluids (CSF). In manual segmentation of brain MRIs physicians manually determines the boundaries of different objects of interest and it is time-consuming and difficult. Thus, several accurate automatic brain MRI segmentation techniques with different levels of complexity have been proposed. This paper proposes an advanced thresholding technique for the segmentation of brain MRIs based on the biologically inspired Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. Here the texture features are assumed as heuristic data. The experimental results for the T1-weighted brain MRIs have shown high accuracy than the conventional such as Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), Expectation-Maximization (EM), Improved Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (IBFA), and Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO).</jats:p>",44,,37,49,Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Artificial intelligence; Pattern recognition; Ant colony optimization algorithms; Computer science; Segmentation,,,,,https://www.scientific.net/JBBBE.44.37,http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/jbbbe.44.37,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/jbbbe.44.37,3007196747,,0,000-006-254-635-143; 006-912-783-912-786; 008-541-071-614-230; 009-798-919-076-063; 011-467-574-129-443; 012-977-217-930-511; 013-384-809-549-135; 025-099-015-917-517; 027-691-578-782-180; 032-155-639-600-03X; 034-473-472-542-320; 038-886-963-014-590; 041-358-692-336-318; 044-757-144-815-091; 051-675-954-907-54X; 052-985-760-288-285; 060-077-780-587-940; 060-344-163-671-93X; 063-667-537-308-63X; 067-528-121-716-424; 071-622-483-397-77X; 073-791-935-430-738; 075-086-734-221-525; 075-107-555-728-339; 078-399-660-434-603; 079-291-136-579-170; 079-320-976-197-087; 080-086-666-289-720; 083-658-574-204-101; 087-331-309-808-183; 091-347-908-539-297; 094-335-530-048-015; 099-822-048-561-806; 109-084-594-013-777; 110-718-833-780-162; 120-567-582-361-402; 121-495-059-756-529; 122-317-861-580-991; 153-050-798-098-16X; 187-076-376-984-46X,4,false,,

This study examines whether social network attributes moderate the association between amygdalar volume and cognitive function. METHODS Data were from the Social Networks in Alzheimer Disease study (N=154) and Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Social networks were measured using the PhenX Social Network Battery. Regional data from MRI (amygdalar volume; AV) were analyzed using FreeSurfer software. Cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and consensus diagnosis. Linear regression analyses were conducted to test the moderating role of social networks on the association between AV and cognitive function. RESULTS Participants with greater ability to span multiple social roles and subgroups within their networks scored higher on the MoCA after adjusting for sociodemographic variables, depression, frequency of contact, and AV. Social networks moderated the association between AV and cognitive function.

We therefore examined the relation between dysglycemia and brain volume and vascular lesions on MRI in a memory clinic population. Methods The relations between markers of glycemia (HbA1c and fasting glucose levels) and normalized brain volume, medial temporal lobe atrophy and vascular lesions (white matter hyperintensities, lacunes) were assessed in 274 consecutive patients attending a memory clinic, using linear regression analyses. Results Clinical diagnoses were subjective complaints (n = 117), mild cognitive impairment (n = 62), Alzheimer's disease (n = 61) and other type of dementia (n = 34). Twenty patients had a history of diabetes. Across the whole study population there was no relation between HbA1c or fasting glucose and the brain MRI measurements, after adjustments for age, sex and diagnostic group. Secondary analyses after stratification by diabetes status, diagnosis and median age (67 years) did not change the results. Conclusion In this memory clinic population, dysglycemia was not associated with either brain volume or vascular lesions. Apparently, dysglycemia is not associated with a specific class of brain pathology in patients with cognitive complaints.",28,1,85,90,Internal medicine; Endocrinology; Hyperintensity; Memory clinic; Dementia; Brain damage; Population; Diabetes mellitus; Population study; Brain size; Medicine,Alzheimer's disease; Brain atrophy; Diabetes; Glucose; HbA1c; Hippocampus; Lacunes; Mild cognitive impairment; White matter hyperintensities,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease/complications; Atrophy/diagnosis; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Brain/blood supply; Cerebrovascular Disorders/complications; Cognitive Dysfunction/complications; Female; Glucose Metabolism Disorders/complications; Glycated Hemoglobin/metabolism; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size","Blood Glucose; Glycated Hemoglobin A; hemoglobin A1c protein, human",Alzheimer Nederland; Stichting Vumc fonds; Stichting Dioraphte; ZonMw; The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development; Utrecht University,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1056872712003406 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23352495 https://research.vumc.nl/en/publications/dysglycemia-brain-volume-and-vascular-lesions-on-mri-in-a-memory- https://core.ac.uk/display/82002016 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.atira.dk%3Apublications%2F9c17cb9f-1c60-4438-b91c-c1cc5a6d4668 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1056872712003406 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23352495/ https://researchinformation.amsterdamumc.org/en/publications/dysglycemia-brain-volume-and-vascular-lesions-on-mri-in-a-memory- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23352495,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2012.12.003,23352495,10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2012.12.003,2140142366,,0,002-455-643-408-733; 004-034-590-035-319; 006-950-100-485-859; 008-172-052-164-093; 011-314-556-840-779; 020-182-469-100-937; 022-555-150-248-464; 029-856-126-468-209; 031-136-752-436-374; 032-688-759-131-604; 043-340-829-163-719; 047-791-528-172-038; 048-536-112-681-339; 051-516-954-422-19X; 051-966-426-773-701; 058-631-373-894-568; 061-044-003-922-463; 063-974-704-155-109; 068-269-434-433-807; 069-243-009-026-953; 070-087-140-191-042; 071-834-937-630-826; 074-811-973-835-375; 076-229-497-315-270; 105-532-650-375-897; 105-934-212-659-218; 110-190-021-928-771; 116-924-008-434-054; 120-557-852-411-205; 130-108-108-532-315; 131-067-271-165-98X; 131-282-252-316-086,18,true,implied-oa,hybrid

These may partly stem from confounding bias, which could distort associations and limit generalizability. We examined how associations between brain morphology and ADHD symptoms change with adjustments for potential confounders typically overlooked in the literature (aim 1), and for the intelligence quotient (IQ) and head motion, which are generally corrected for but play ambiguous roles (aim 2). Methods: Participants were 10-year-old children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (N = 7722) and Generation R (N = 2531) Studies. Cortical area, volume, and thickness were measured with MRI and ADHD symptoms with the Child Behavior Checklist. Surface-based cross-sectional analyses were run. Results: ADHD symptoms related to widespread cortical regions when solely adjusting for demographic factors. Additional adjustments for socioeconomic and maternal behavioral confounders (aim 1) generally attenuated associations, as cluster sizes halved and effect sizes substantially reduced. Cluster sizes further changed when including IQ and head motion (aim 2), however, we argue that adjustments might have introduced bias. Conclusions: Careful confounder selection and control can help identify more robust and specific regions of associations for ADHD symptoms, across two cohorts. We provided guidance to minimizing confounding bias in psychiatric neuroimaging.

The strength of the evidence presented is convincing and solid. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.78002.sa0 Decision letter Reviews on Sciety eLife's review process Introduction Large strides have been made in the identification of neuroanatomical correlates of psychiatric problems, with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) being a prominent example. ADHD is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in children worldwide and is characterized by atypical levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Structural magnetic resonance imaging studies have highlighted that children with ADHD show widespread morphological differences, such as in the basal ganglia (Nakao et al., 2011), subcortical areas (Hoogman et al., 2017), and frontal, cingulate, and temporal cortices, compared to children without the disorder (Hoogman et al., 2019; Shaw et al., 2013). Consistently identifying the neuroanatomical substrate of ADHD, however, remains challenging. A recent meta-analysis did not find convergence across the literature on brain differences in children and adolescents with ADHD (Samea et al., 2019). One possible explanation for this inconsistency is the multifaceted nature of ADHD, in which children with the disorder have heterogeneous presentations on several cognitive and emotional domains, which could stem from distinct brain structural substrates. Other explanations regard study design. If suboptimal, it may lead to biased estimates and lack of generalizability, thus potentially concealing robust and replicable relations of brain morphology with ADHD. The present study focuses on confounding, a common source of bias in etiological studies. Confounding bias arises when a third variable affects both the determinant (independent variable) and outcome (dependent variable) of interest (i.e., is a common cause) (VanderWeele, 2019). Confounding leads to over- or underestimation of the true effect between determinant and outcome and can even change the direction of an association. To minimize confounding bias, appropriate confounder control is paramount, although it is challenging, especially in observational studies like most neuroimaging studies of ADHD. Previous literature and expert knowledge can guide the identification of potential confounders (Hernan and Robins, 2020), which can then be appropriately adjusted for in regression models or using methods such as restriction, standardization, or propensity scores. Within neuroimaging studies of ADHD, except for a few large investigations (Hoogman et al., 2017; Mous et al., 2014; Bernanke et al., 2022), studies have generally matched or adjusted for a few demographic variables (e.g., age and sex) and neuroimaging metrics or parameters. Of the 19 studies included in a systematic review of neuroimaging studies on ADHD (Saad et al., 2020), 17 adjusted or matched for age in their analyses, 14 for sex, 9 for neuroimaging-related variables like head motion during scanning, and 8 for the intelligence quotient (IQ) (Supplementary file 1a). Further potential confounders should, however, be considered. For instance, socioeconomic status (SES) is related to both higher risk for ADHD and variation in cortical brain structure (Russell et al., 2016; Noble et al., 2015). Thus, it is likely a confounder. Lack of adjustment for SES may have therefore concealed key relations between ADHD and brain structure. Adjustment choices are dependent on the availability of large samples with data on a wide variety of covariates, which has to date been limited for psychiatric neuroimaging studies. Yet, this is rapidly changing with the advent of population neuroscience, which entails large-scale studies with neurobiological data. This lends new opportunities for further confounder adjustments to be considered in neuroimaging studies of ADHD. Conversely, previous studies have adjusted for IQ and head motion, which may not be confounders in the association between ADHD symptoms and the brain, and may thus have led to further bias in the results (Dennis et al., 2009). In this study, we examined the association between brain structure and ADHD symptoms and how the selection and control for potential confounders may affect results (aim 1). Moreover, we discussed the complex role of IQ and head motion in brain structure–ADHD associations and the potential consequences of adjusting for them (aim 2). We leveraged two large, population-based cohorts: the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and the Generation R Studies. In line with most neuroimaging studies, we adopted a cross-sectional design. Results Associations between ADHD symptoms and brain morphology are widespread We analyzed data from 10-year-old children from the ABCD (N = 7722, multisite) and Generation R (N = 2531, single-site) Studies (Supplementary file 1b). ADHD symptoms were measured with the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL). T1-weighted images were obtained with 3T scanners (Casey et al., 2018; Kooijman et al., 2016). We ran vertex-wise linear regression models for ADHD with cortical surface area, volume, and thickness. Results for surface area, which constituted the main findings here, are presented in-text, while findings for volume and thickness in the figure supplements. We adjusted for demographic and study characteristics which have been generally considered by previous literature (Supplementary file 1a): age, sex, ethnicity, and study site (ABCD only). We refer to this model as model 1, as further adjustments for confounders are outlined in subsequent steps. We found that higher ADHD symptoms were associated with less bilateral surface area in both cohorts. As shown in Figure 1, associations were widespread, as the clusters of association covered 1165.7 cm2 of the cerebral cortex in the ABCD Study, and 446.1 cm2 in the Generation R Study. Across both cohorts, we consistently identified clusters for surface area in the lateral occipital, postcentral, rostral middle and superior frontal, and superior parietal cortices. For cortical thickness, we found two small frontal clusters in the ABCD Study (16.1 cm2) and no clusters in the Generation R Study, which suggests that cortical thickness does not relate or does not relate strongly to ADHD, in line with prior literature (Hoogman et al., 2019; Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Figure 1 with 2 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Significant clusters in the association of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms with cortical surface area based on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and Generation R Studies, for model 1. Note. Rows represent the results for the ABCD or Generation R Studies, and the columns represent the left and right hemispheres. Regions in red represent significant clusters from model 1 (adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and site [ABCD only]). Confounder selection: socioeconomic and maternal behavioral factors Next, we considered factors that have been previously linked to ADHD and brain structure in the literature, and are thus potential confounders. To illustrate this background knowledge and the assumptions about relations between variables, we used Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), a type of causal diagram (Hernan and Robins, 2020). These guide the identification (and dismissal) of covariates that may act as confounders. Of note, while assumptions may not hold, this theoretical approach is preferred to methods selecting confounders based on model statistics (Lee, 2014). The DAGs are depicted in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2, and the rationales for variable inclusion are explained below and in the Methods. Figure 2 with 2 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for brain structure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms (simplified). Note. DAGs illustrating potential confounders in the association between brain structure and ADHD symptoms for three sequential models. Model 1 included demographic and study characteristics: sex, age, ethnicity, and study site (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development [ABCD] only) (in blue). Model 2 additionally included socioeconomic status factors: family income, maternal education, and maternal age at childbirth (in red). Model 3 additionally incorporated postnatal maternal psychopathology and maternal substance use during pregnancy (in green). Based on the literature, lower SES is associated with a higher risk for ADHD (Russell et al., 2016) and with variation in cortical brain structure (Noble et al., 2015). Thus, confounding by socioeconomic factors in the relation between ADHD and brain morphology is likely. We therefore additionally adjusted for a second set of confounders (model 2) related to SES: household income, maternal education, and maternal age at childbirth. Moreover, several factors concerning maternal behavior, pre- and postnatally, have been associated with both ADHD and brain morphology. For instance, prenatal exposure to substances is known to increase the risk of developing ADHD symptoms and has been associated with variation in cerebral volume and surface area (Eilertsen et al., 2017; Lees et al., 2020). Postnatal maternal psychopathology has been linked to higher child ADHD symptoms (Clavarino et al., 2010) and smaller brain volume in children (Zou et al., 2019). Thus, in model 3 we additionally adjusted for prenatal exposure to substance use (tobacco and cannabis), and postnatal maternal psychopathology. Adjusting for additional confounders led to reductions in the clusters of association Adjustments for SES (model 2) led to reductions in the spatial extent of the clusters for surface area and volume in both cohorts (Figure 3). For surface area, cluster sizes for ADHD symptoms reduced from 1165.7 cm2 in model 1 to 952.8 cm2 in model 2 (=−18%) in the ABCD Study, and from 446.1 to 229.6 cm2 (=−49%) in the Generation R Study. Similar reductions were observed for volume and thickness (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). After adjusting for the confounders added in model 3, across both cohorts, we consistently identified clusters for surface area in the cuneus, precuneus, fusiform, inferior parietal, isthmus of the cingulate, pericalcarine, pre- and postcentral, rostral middle and superior frontal, superior temporal and supramarginal cortices.

Note. Rows represent the results for the ABCD or Generation R Studies, and the columns represent the left and right hemispheres. The colors denote the different models. Regions in red represent significant clusters from model 1 (sex, age, race/ethnicity, and site [ABCD only]), orange from model 2 (model 1 + family income, maternal education, and maternal age at childbirth), and yellow from model 3 (model 2 + maternal smoking, substance use during pregnancy, psychopathology). Similar results were observed for ADHD diagnosis To explore whether the results observed for associations between brain morphology and ADHD symptoms applied to children with an ADHD diagnosis, we repeated the primary analysis using the ADHD diagnostic data from the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (KSADS) in the ABCD Study. In line with our primary results, ADHD diagnosis was associated with less bilateral surface area and volume. Compared to clusters for ADHD symptoms, those associated with ADHD diagnosis were smaller, but overlapping (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We observed similar patterns of reduction in the spatial extent of the clusters after adjusting for each set of confounders (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). For surface area, cluster sizes for ADHD symptoms covered 234.4 cm2 in model 1 and reduced to 199.5 cm2 in model 2 (=−15%), and 55.5 cm2 in model 3 (=−72%, compared to model 2). Beta coefficients generally decreased after confounder adjustments, but may also increase Surface-based studies generally focus on the spatial extent of cortical clusters associated with the phenotype, but, in this study, we also explored how confounding adjustments affected the regression coefficients for ADHD symptoms (Figure 4). Figure 4 with 5 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Region-based average regression coefficients for surface area in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and Generation R Studies. Note. The colors denote the different models, and the circles denote the average of all the betas within that region. The regions are based on the Desikan–Killiany atlas. Results for the ABCD and Generation R Studies are, respectively, shown on the top and bottom. At a vertex-wise level, adjusting for socioeconomic and maternal factors (model 3) led to reductions in the beta coefficients, across the brain, for both cohorts (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Of note, some beta coefficients also showed increases. As confounding bias may lead to under- or overestimation, it is not surprising to observe both decreases and increases in the average beta coefficients after adjustments. At an anatomical region level, where estimates of vertices within a given Desikan–Killiany region were averaged, beta coefficients for surface area tended to decrease from model 1 to 2 by approximately 15% (Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Further adjustments from model 2 to 3 led to decreases in the average beta coefficients of certain regions and increases in others. Similar patterns were found for volume (Figure 4—figure supplements 3 and 4). The average beta coefficients per region correlated moderately to strongly between the ABCD and Generation R Studies for surface area (Spearman rM1 = 0.84, rM2 = 0.83, rM3 = 0.83) and volume (Spearman rM1 = 0.57, rM2 = 0.57, rM3 = 0.70) (Figure 4—figure supplement 5). IQ may be a confounder, mediator, or collider in neuroanatomical studies of ADHD We considered one additional scenario which included IQ, a factor that is often adjusted for in previous studies (Supplementary file 1a). However, based on prior literature, it holds an ambiguous role in structural anatomy–ADHD relations. Previous studies found that children with ADHD scored lower on IQ than children without ADHD (Bridgett and Walker, 2006). Differential brain structure with levels of IQ has also been shown (Mcdaniel, 2005). However, the directions of causation between these variables remain unclear (Gallo and Posner, 2016). IQ may therefore be a confounder, collider, and/or mediator in the relation between brain structure and ADHD, as depicted in the DAGs in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1. Figure 5 with 1 supplement see all Download asset Open asset Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for intelligence quotient (IQ), brain structure, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Note. (A) DAG for IQ as a confounder. In this case, adjustments are needed as the backdoor path from brain structure to ADHD symptoms through IQ is open. By adjusting (box around IQ), the path gets closed. (B) DAG for IQ as a mediator. Adjustments are not needed to estimate the total effect of brain structure on ADHD symptoms. (C) DAG for IQ as a collider. The backdoor path through IQ is already closed. Adjustments would open the path and lead to collider bias. First, it could be argued that IQ is partly innate and precedes brain development and ADHD, making it a confounder (Figure 5A). Second, IQ may lie in the pathway between brain structure and ADHD and therefore act as a mediator (Figure 5B). It is conceivable that cognitive differences, as a consequence of subtle neurodevelopmental differences (Lee et al., 2019), could underlie ADHD. Adjusting for a mediator would lead to bias when estimating the total association between brain structure and ADHD (VanderWeele, 2016). Third, brain structure may impact intelligence scores (Lee et al., 2019), and ADHD symptoms may affect IQ test performance (Jepsen et al., 2009; Figure 5C). A variable that is independently caused by the outcome and the determinant is also known as a collider, and adjusting for it leads to (collider) bias. Here, we explored the impact of adjusting for IQ when examining the relation between brain morphology and ADHD (model 4). Adjustments for IQ led to further cluster reductions After additionally adjusting for IQ, the spatial extent of the clusters associated with ADHD symptoms reduced further in both cohorts (Figure 6). For surface area, compared to model 3, clusters reduced from 760.2 to 605.1 cm2 (=−20%) for the ABCD Study, and from 208.6 to 93.1 cm2 for the Generation R Study (=−55%). Clusters of association for surface area in model 4 were located in the fusiform, inferior parietal, insula, lateral occipital, middle temporal, pericalcarine, pre- and postcentral, precuneus, rostral middle, and superior frontal, superior parietal and temporal, and supramarginal cortices. Findings for volume and thickness are shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.

Note. Rows represent the results for the ABCD or Generation R Studies, and the columns represent the left and right hemispheres. The colors denote the different models, with red vertices being significant only in model 3, orange ones in both model 3 and after adjustment for IQ, and yellow ones only after adjusting for IQ. Head motion does not induce confounding bias, but information bias A final scenario was also included, to reflect the commonly used adjustments for head motion during scanning (Supplementary file 1a). Motion can be a large source of bias in neuroimaging studies which is important to address. While it does not meet the criteria for confounding as it is not a common cause of ADHD problems and brain morphology (Hernan and Robins, 2020), head motion can induce measurement error of brain morphology (Van de Walle et al., 1997; Figure 7). This is also referred to as information bias and can distort estimates from their true value. Figure 7 Download asset Open asset Information bias for brain structure, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, and head motion. Note. From the bottom up: We aim to measure the ‘true’ values of brain structure and ADHD symptoms. However, we actually measure both brain structure and ADHD symptoms imperfectly, at the MRI and through self-reports, respectively. What we assess is therefore affected by measurement errors. Error in the MRI measurement is determined, in part, by excessive motion during scanning. Higher ADHD symptoms likely cause higher motion (dotted red path). This leads to differential information bias and creates a non-causal path from ADHD symptoms to brain structure through motion. The amount of measurement error in brain morphology may differ across children with versus without ADHD. In fact, children with impulsivity and inattention have been shown to move more during MRI scanning (Thomson et al., 2021; Kong et al., 2014), determining different levels of error in the brain morphology assessments (Figure 7, path from ADHD symptoms to motion to error in MRI measurement). In this scenario, adjusting for motion might lead to two situations. On one hand, since motion is a consequence of the outcome (ADHD), adjustments would lead to bias (Westreich, 2012). On the other hand, not adjusting for motion would also lead to bias because part of the observed relation between ADHD symptoms and brain structure would be due to the higher head motion (and thus the underestimation of the cortical values) of children with ADHD. In this study, we explored the effect of adjusting for motion during scanning in the relation between brain morphology and ADHD (model 5). Adjustments for head motion led to increases in clusters After additional adjustments for head motion, the spatial extent of the clusters generally increased. For surface area, compared to model 3, clusters increased from 760.2 to 936.4 cm2 (=+23.2%) for the ABCD Study and from 208.6 to 239.7 cm2 (=+14.9%) for the Generation R Study (Figure 8). Clusters of associations consistently found across cohorts were highly similar to the ones identified in model 3. Results for cortical volume and thickness are shown in Figure 8—figure supplement 1.

Note. Rows represent the results for the ABCD or Generation R Studies, and the columns represent the left and right hemispheres. The colors denote the different models, with red vertices being significant only in model 3, orange ones in both model 3 and after adjustment for motion, and yellow ones only after adjusting for motion. Discussion By leveraging two large population-based studies and adopting a literature- and DAG-informed approach to address confounding, we showed that (1) associations between brain structure and ADHD symptoms, which were initially widespread, reduced when adjusting for socioeconomic and maternal behavioral confounders, and that (2) careful considerations are needed when including IQ and/or head motion due to their complex relation with ADHD and brain morphology. Adjustments for confounders highlighted key regions of association, observed across two large cohorts Widespread associations between surface area and ADHD symptoms were initially identified, with higher symptoms relating to smaller brain structures, in line with previous research (Hoogman et al., 2019; Gehricke et al., 2017). After adjustments for potential confounders typically overlooked by prior literature (socioeconomic and maternal behavioral factors), approximately half of the associations remained, and considerable effect size changes were observed in both the ABCD and Generation R Studies and for all cortical measures. We observed similar patterns of cluster reductions for ADHD diagnosis in the ABCD Study. Regions that remained associated after adjustments and which were consistently identified across cohorts were the precuneus, isthmus of the cingulate, supramarginal, pre- and postcentral, and inferior parietal cortices for both area and volume. Most of these regions (e.g., supramarginal) have been previously implicated in ADHD in clinical samples (Saad et al., 2017; Lei et al., 2014; Solanto et al., 2009). However, many different brain areas have been detected in association with the disorder (Saad et al., 2020), which may have hampered prior meta-analytic efforts to identify consistent neuroanatomical correlates for ADHD. Of note, some inconsistencies between the ABCD and Generation R Studies, both in size of the clusters and the exact location, were observed. While we used the same processing pipelines and similar quality control procedures and measures across cohorts, potential reasons for discrepancies in results must be discussed. First, the larger sample size of the ABCD Study allows for greater power to detect smaller effects, which led to larger associated areas. Second, the multisite structure of the ABCD Study may have introduced noise in the results (e.g., by different scanners, demographic differences), and determined the identification of associations which are not replicable in the Generation R Study. Third, the two studies include children from different populations. While both are very diverse samples, the ABCD Study is comprised of a more heterogeneous sample from the US population, which, for instance, is characterized by a wider variety of ethnicities and cultures, potentially permitting the discovery of more associations. Nevertheless, there was considerable overlap in the findings from the ABCD and Generation R Studies, with consistencies across cohorts indicating the most robust and generalizable associations. Here, we discerned associated areas likely subject to confounding bias from areas robust to socioeconomic and maternal behavioral factors, and replicable across two large cohorts. Comparisons with prior findings should be made with caution due to differences in study design, samples (clinical vs. population-based), and analytical methods. Importantly, we highlighted the opportunity for future studies to include covariates that go beyond age and sex, can help refine associations, and can be readily collected. Future studies may want to consider other confounding factors, depending on their research question, design, and assumed causal relations. Adjustments for IQ are often unnecessary when examining the relation between brain structure and ADHD Avoiding bias from adjusting for variables that are not confounders is as important as identifying sources of confounding. Adjusting for mediators or colliders of the ADHD–brain structure relation would induce bias. Here, when adjusting for IQ, which plays an unclear role in brain structure–ADHD associations, cluster sizes reduced considerably in both the ABCD and Generation R Studies. This could indicate that IQ is a confounder, in which case adjustments would be necessary, or that IQ is a mediator or collider, in which case adjustments must be avoided. First, based on previous literature and this study, the association between ADHD and IQ is relatively weak (Dennis et al., 2009) (rABCD = −0.11, rGENR = −0.14), but this does not necessarily make it a weak confounder as the strength of confounding is due to a variable’s relation with the exposure and outcome. Second, if brain structure and ADHD symptoms both cause cognitive changes, adjusting for IQ could induce collider bias, although this is also dependent on when IQ is measured relative to the exposure and outcome (Hernan and Robins, 2020). Third, if brain structure determines cognitive functioning, which in turn affects ADHD symptoms (mediation by IQ), adjustments would also induce bias (VanderWeele, 2016). Given these scenarios, we recommend moving away from routinely adjusting for IQ in ADHD neuroimaging studies, and we highlight the need to carefully consider the causal model for a specific research question to determine whether IQ may confound associations. There is no easy fix for dealing with head motion in brain morphology–ADHD associations Adjustments for neuroimaging covariates, such as head motion, are often run to reduce confounding bias. However, head motion, rather than inducing confounding bias, creates measurement error (information bias). When adjusting for head motion during scanning, we observed increases in the spatial extent of the clusters. This might indicate a reduction or an increase in bias. First, bias might have been reduced by adjusting for the fact that children with ADHD will have more error in their cortical measures.

In this work, we assembled a reference cohort of neuroimaging data from 82 sites (N=58,836; ages 2–100) and used normative modeling to characterize lifespan trajectories of cortical thickness and subcortical volume. Models are validated against a manually quality checked subset (N=24,354) and we provide an interface for transferring to new data sources. We showcase the clinical value by applying the models to a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample (N=1985), showing they can be used to quantify variability underlying multiple disorders whilst also refining case-control inferences. These models will be augmented with additional samples and imaging modalities as they become available. This provides a common reference platform to bind results from different studies and ultimately paves the way for personalized clinical decision-making. Editor's evaluation This manuscript is of broad interest to the neuroimaging community. It establishes a detailed reference model of human brain development and lifespan trajectories based on a very large data set, across many cortical and subcortical brain regions. The model not only explains substantial variability on test data, it also successfully uncovers individual differences on a database of psychiatric patients that, in addition to group-level analyses, may be critical for diagnosis, thereby demonstrating high clinical potential. It presents a clear overview of the data resource, including detailed evaluation metrics, and makes code, models and documentation directly available to the community. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72904.sa0 Decision letter Reviews on Sciety eLife's review process Introduction Since their introduction more than a century ago, normative growth charts have become fundamental tools in pediatric medicine and also in many other areas of anthropometry (Cole, 2012). They provide the ability to quantify individual variation against centiles of variation in a reference population, which shifts focus away from group-level (e.g., case-control) inferences to the level of the individual. This idea has been adopted and generalized in clinical neuroimaging, and normative modeling is now established as an effective technique for providing inferences at the level of the individual in neuroimaging studies (Marquand et al., 2016; Marquand et al., 2019). Although normative modeling can be used to estimate many different kinds of mappings—for example between behavioral scores and neurobiological readouts—normative models of brain development and aging are appealing considering that many brain disorders are grounded in atypical trajectories of brain development (Insel, 2014) and the association between cognitive decline and brain tissue in aging and neurodegenerative diseases (Jack et al., 2010; Karas et al., 2004). Indeed, normative modeling has been applied in many different clinical contexts, including charting the development of infants born pre-term (Dimitrova et al., 2020) and dissecting the biological heterogeneity across cohorts of individuals with different brain disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Bethlehem et al., 2020; Wolfers et al., 2021; Zabihi et al., 2019). A hurdle to the widespread application of normative modeling is a lack of well-defined reference models to quantify variability across the lifespan and to compare results from different studies. Such models should: (1) accurately model population variation across large samples; (2) be derived from widely accessible measures; (3) provide the ability to be updated as additional data come online, (4) be supported by easy-to-use software tools, and (5) should quantify brain development and aging at a high spatial resolution, so that different patterns of atypicality can be used to stratify cohorts and predict clinical outcomes with maximum spatial precision. Prior work on building normative modeling reference cohorts (Bethlehem et al., 2021) has achieved some of these aims (1–4), but has modeled only global features (i.e., total brain volume), which is useful for quantifying brain growth but has limited utility for the purpose of stratifying clinical cohorts (aim 5). The purpose of this paper is to introduce a set of reference models that satisfy all these criteria. To this end, we assemble a large neuroimaging data set (Table 1) from 58,836 individuals across 82 scan sites covering the human lifespan (aged 2–100, Figure 1A) and fit normative models for cortical thickness and subcortical volumes derived from Freesurfer (version 6.0). We show the clinical utility of these models in a large transdiagnostic psychiatric sample (N=1985, Figure 2). To maximize the utility of this contribution, we distribute model coefficients freely along with a set of software tools to enable researchers to derive subject-level predictions for new data sets against a set of common reference models.

Results We split the available data into training and test sets, stratifying by site (Table 1, Supplementary files 1 and 2). After careful quality checking procedures, we fit normative models using a set of covariates (age, sex, and fixed effects for site) to predict cortical thickness and subcortical volume for each parcel in a high-resolution atlas (Destrieux et al., 2010). We employed a warped Bayesian linear regression model to accurately model non-linear and non-Gaussian effects (Fraza et al., 2021), whilst accounting for scanner effects (Bayer et al., 2021; Kia et al., 2021). These models are summarized in Figure 1 and Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplements 1–3, and with an online interactive visualization tool for exploring the evaluation metrics across different test sets (overview of this tool shown in Video 1). The raw data used in these visualizations are available on GitHub (Rutherford, 2022a). Figure 3 with 3 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Evaluation metrics across all test sets. The distribution of evaluation metrics in four different test sets (full, mQC, patients, and transfer, see Materials and methods) separated into left and right hemispheres and subcortical regions, with the skew and excess kurtosis being measures that depict the accuracy of the estimated shape of the model, ideally both would be around zero. Note that kurtosis is highly sensitive to outlying samples. Overall, these models show that the models fit well in term of central tendency and variance (explained variance and MSLL) and model the shape of the distribution well in most regions (skew and kurtosis). Code and sample data for transferring these models to new sites not included in training is shared.

We validate our models with several careful procedures: first, we report out of sample metrics; second, we perform a supplementary analysis on a subset of participants for whom input data had undergone manual quality checking by an expert rater (Table 1 – mQC). Third, each model fit was evaluated using metrics (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplements 1–3) that quantify central tendency and distributional accuracy (Dinga et al., 2021; Fraza et al., 2021). We also estimated separate models for males and females, which indicate that sex effects are adequately modeled using a global offset. Finally, to facilitate independent validation, we packaged pretrained models and code for transferring to new samples into an open resource for use by the community and demonstrated how to transfer the models to new samples (i.e., data not present in the initial training set). Our models provide the opportunity for mapping the diverse trajectories of different brain areas. Several examples are shown in Figure 1C and D which align with known patterns of development and aging (Ducharme et al., 2016; Gogtay et al., 2004; Tamnes et al., 2010). Moreover, across the cortex and subcortex our model fits well, explaining up to 80% of the variance out of sample (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplements 1–3). A goal of this work is to develop normative models that can be applied to many different clinical conditions. To showcase this, we apply the model to a transdiagnostic psychiatric cohort (Table 1 – Clinical; Figure 2) resulting in personalized, whole-brain deviation maps that can be used to understand inter-individual variability (e.g., for stratification) and to quantify group separation (e.g., case-control effects). To demonstrate this, for each clinical group, we summarized the individual deviations within that group by computing the proportion of subjects that have deviations in each region and comparing to matched (same sites) controls in the test set (Figure 2B–C). Additionally, we performed case-control comparisons on the raw cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, and on the deviation maps (Figure 2D), again against a matched sample from the test set. This demonstrates the advantages of using normative models for investigating individual differences in psychiatry, that is, quantifying clinically relevant information at the level of each individual. For most diagnostic groups, the z-statistics derived from the normative deviations also provided stronger case-control effects than the raw data. This shows the importance of accurate modeling of population variance across multiple clinically relevant dimensions. The individual-level deviations provide complimentary information to the group effects, which aligns with previous work (Wolfers et al., 2018; Wolfers et al., 2020; Zabihi et al., 2020). We note that a detailed description of the clinical significance of our findings is beyond the scope of this work and will be presented separately. Discussion In this work, we create lifespan brain charts of cortical thickness and subcortical volume derived from structural MRI, to serve as reference models. Multiple data sets were joined to build a mega-site lifespan reference cohort to provide good coverage of the lifespan. We applied the reference cohort models to clinical data sets and demonstrated the benefits of normative modeling in addition to standard case-control comparisons. All models, including documentation and code, are made available to the research community. We also provide an example data set (that includes data from sites not in the training sample) along with the code to demonstrate how well our models can adapt to new sites, and how easy it is to transfer our pretrained models to users' own data sets. We identify three main strengths of our approach. First, our large lifespan data set provides high anatomical specificity, necessary for discriminating between conditions, predicting outcomes, and stratifying subtypes. Second, our models are flexible in that they can model non-Gaussian distributions, can easily be transferred to new sites, and are built on validated analytical techniques and software tools (Fraza et al., 2021; Kia et al., 2021; Marquand et al., 2019). Third, we show the general utility of this work in that it provides the ability to map individual variation whilst also improving case-control inferences across multiple disorders. In recent work, a large consortium established lifespan brain charts that are complementary to our approach (Bethlehem et al., 2021). Benefits of their work include precisely quantifying brain growth using a large cohort, but they only provide estimates of four coarse global measures (e.g., total brain volume). While this can precisely quantify brain growth and aging this does not provide the ability to generate individualized fingerprints or to stratify clinical cohorts. In contrast, in this work, we focus on providing spatially specific estimates (188 different brain regions) across the post-natal lifespan which provides fine-grained anatomical estimates of deviation, offering an individualized perspective that can be used for clinical stratification. We demonstrate the transdiagnostic clinical value of our models (Figure 2) by showing how clinical variation is widespread in a fine-grain manner (e.g., not all individuals deviate in the same regions and not all disorders have the same characteristic patterns) and we facilitate clinical applications of our models by sharing tutorial code notebooks with sample data that can be run locally or online in a web browser. We also identify the limitations of this work. We view the word 'normative' as problematic. This language implies that there are normal and abnormal brains, a potentially problematic assumption. As indicated in Figure 2, there is considerable individual variability and heterogeneity among trajectories. We encourage the use of the phrase 'reference cohort' over 'normative model'. In order to provide coverage of the lifespan the curated data set is based on aggregating existing data, meaning there is unavoidable sampling bias. Race, education, and socioeconomic variables were not fully available for all included data sets, however, given that data were compiled from research studies, they are likely samples drawn predominantly from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies (Henrich et al., 2010) and future work should account for these factors. The sampling bias of UKBiobank (Fry et al., 2017) is especially important for users to consider as UKBiobank data contributes 59% of the full sample. By sampling both healthy population samples and case-control studies, we achieve a reasonable estimate of variation across individuals, however, downstream analyses should consider the nature of the reference cohort and whether it is appropriate for the target sample. Second, we have relied on semi-automated quality control (QC) for the full sample which—despite a conservative choice of inclusion threshold—does not guarantee either that low-quality data were excluded or that the data were excluded are definitively excluded because of artifacts. We addressed this by comparing our full test set to a manually quality check data set and observed similar model performance. Also, Freesurfer was not adjusted for the very young age ranges (2–7 yo) thus caution should be used when interpreting the model on new data in this age range. Finally, although the models presented in this study are comprehensive, they are only the first step, and we will augment our repository with more diverse data, different features, and modeling advances as these become available. Materials and methods Data from 82 sites were combined to create the initial full sample. These sites are described in detail in Supplementary files 1-2, including the sample size, age (mean and standard deviation), and sex distribution of each site. Many sites were pulled from publicly available data sets including ABCD, ABIDE, ADHD200, CAMCAN, CMI-HBN, HCP-Aging, HCP-Development, HCP-Early Psychosis, HCP-Young Adult, IXI, NKI-RS, Oasis, OpenNeuro, PNC, SRPBS, and UKBiobank. For data sets that include repeated visits (i.e., ABCD and UKBiobank), only the first visit was included. Other included data come from studies conducted at the University of Michigan (Duval et al., 2018; Rutherford et al., 2020; Tomlinson et al., 2020; Tso et al., 2021; Weigard et al., 2021; Zucker et al., 2009), University of California Davis (Nordahl et al., 2020), University of Oslo (Nesvåg et al., 2017), King's College London (Green et al., 2012; Lythe et al., 2015), and Amsterdam University Medical Center (Mocking et al., 2016). Full details regarding sample characteristics, diagnostic procedures, and acquisition protocols can be found in the publications associated with each of the studies. Equal sized training and testing data sets (split half) were created using scikit-learn's train_test_split function, stratifying on the site variable. It is important to stratify based on site, not only study (Bethlehem et al., 2021), as many of the public studies (i.e., ABCD) include several sites, thus modeling study does not adequately address MRI scanner confounds. To test stability of the model performance, the full test set was randomly resampled 10 times and evaluation metrics were re-calculated on each split of the full test set (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). To show generalizability of the models to new data not included in training, we leveraged data from OpenNeuro.org (Markiewicz et al., 2021) to create a transfer data set (six sites, N=546, Supplementary file 3). This data are provided along with the code for transferring to walk users through how to apply these models to their own data. The clinical validation sample consisted of a subset of the full data set (described in detail in Figure 1A, Figure 2A and Supplementary file 1). Studies (sites) contributing clinical data included: Autism Brain Imaging Database Exchange (ABIDE GU, KKI, NYU, USM), ADHD200 (KKI, NYU), CNP, SRPBS (CIN, COI, KTT, KUT, HKH, HRC, HUH, SWA, UTO), Delta (AmsterdamUMC), Human Connectome Project Early Psychosis (HCP-EP BWH, IU, McL, MGH), KCL, University of Michigan Children Who Stutter (UMich_CWS), University of Michigan Social Anxiety Disorder (UMich_SAD), University of Michigan Schizophrenia Gaze Processing (UMich_SZG), and TOP (University of Oslo). In addition to the sample-specific inclusion criteria, inclusion criteria for the full sample were based on participants having basic demographic information (age and sex), a T1-weighted MRI volume, and Freesurfer output directories that include summary files that represent left and right hemisphere cortical thickness values of the Destrieux parcellation and subcortical volumetric values (aseg.stats, lh.aparc.a2009s.stats, and rh.aparc.a2009s.stats). Freesurfer image analysis suite (version 6.0) was used for cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation for all studies. The technical details of these procedures are described in prior publications (Dale et al., 1999; Fischl et al., 2002; Fischl and Dale, 2000). UK Biobank was the only study for which Freesurfer was not run by the authors. Freesurfer functions aparcstats2table and asegstats2table were run to extract cortical thickness from the Destrieux parcellation (Destrieux et al., 2010) and subcortical volume for all participants into CSV files. These files were inner merged with the demographic files, using Pandas, and NaN rows were dropped. QC is an important consideration for large samples and is an active research area (Alfaro-Almagro et al., 2018; Klapwijk et al., 2019; Rosen et al., 2018). We consider manual quality checking of images both prior to and after preprocessing to be the gold standard. However, this is labor intensive and prohibitive for very large samples. Therefore, in this work, we adopt a pragmatic and multi-pronged approach to QC. First, a subset of the full data set underwent manual quality checking (mQC) by author S.R. Papaya, a JavaScript-based image viewer. Manual quality checking was performed during December 2020 when the Netherlands was in full lockdown due to COVID-19 and S.R. was living alone in a new country with a lot of free time. Data included in this manual QC step was based on what was available at the time (Supplementary file 2). Later data sets that were included were not manually QC'd due to resource and time constraints. Scripts were used to initialize a manual QC session and track progress and organize ratings. All images (T1w volume and Freesurfer brain.finalsurfs) were put into JSON files that the mQC script would call when loading Papaya. Images were rated using a 'pass/fail/flag' scale and the rating was tracked in an automated manner using keyboard inputs (up arrow=pass, down arrow=fail, F key=flag, and left/right arrows were used to move through subjects). Each subject's T1w volume was viewed in 3D volumetric space, with the Freesurfer brain.finalsurfs file as an overlay, to check for obvious quality issues such as excessive motion, ghosting or ringing artifacts. Example scripts used for quality checking and further instructions for using the manual QC environment can be found on GitHub(Rutherford, 2022c copy archived at swh:1:rev:70894691c74febe2a4d40ab0c84c50094b9e99ce). We relied on ABCD consortium QC procedures for the QC for this sample. The ABCD study data distributes a variable (freesqc01.txt; fsqc_qc = = 1/0) that represents manual quality checking (pass/fail) of the T1w volume and Freesurfer data, thus this data set was added into our manual quality checked data set bringing the sample size to 24,354 individuals passing manual quality checks. Note that QC was performed on the data prior to splitting of the data to assess generalizability. Although this has a reduced sample, we consider this to be a gold-standard sample in that every single scan has been checked manually. All inferences reported in this manuscript were validated against this sample. Second, for the full sample, we adopted an automated QC procedure that quantifies image quality based on the Freesurfer Euler Characteristic (EC), which has been shown to be an excellent proxy for manual labeling of scan quality (Monereo-Sánchez et al., 2021; Rosen et al., 2018) and is the most important feature in automated scan quality classifiers (Klapwijk et al., 2019). Since the distribution of the EC varies across sites, we adopt a simple approach that involves scaling and centering the distribution over the EC across sites and removing samples in the tail of the distribution (see Kia et al., 2021 for details). While any automated QC heuristic is by definition imperfect, we note that this is based on a conservative inclusion threshold such that only samples well into the tail of the EC distribution are excluded, which are likely to be caused by true topological defects rather than abnormalities due to any underlying pathology. We separated the evaluation metrics into full test set (relying on automated QC) and mQC test set in order to compare model performance between the two QC approaches and were pleased to notice that the evaluation metrics were nearly identical across the two methods. Normative modeling was run using python 3.8 and the PCNtoolkit package (version 0.20). Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) with likelihood warping was used to predict cortical thickness and subcortical volume from a vector of covariates (age, sex, and site). For a complete mathematical description and explanation of this implementation, see Fraza et al., 2021. Briefly, for each brain region of interest (cortical thickness or subcortical volume), y is predicted as: (1) y=wTϕx+ϵ where wT is the estimated weight vector, ϕx is a basis expansion of the of covariate vector x, consisting of a B-spline basis expansion (cubic spline with five evenly spaced knots) to model non-linear effects of age, and ϵ=η0,β a Gaussian noise distribution with mean zero and noise precision term β (the inverse variance). A likelihood warping approach (Rios and Tobar, 2019; Snelson et al., 2003) was used to model non-Gaussian effects. This involves applying a bijective non-linear warping function to the non-Gaussian response variables to map them to a Gaussian latent space where inference can be performed in closed form. We employed a 'sinarcsinsh' warping function, which is equivalent to the SHASH distribution commonly used in the generalized additive modeling literature (Jones and Pewsey, 2009) and which we have found to perform well in prior work (Dinga et al., 2021; Fraza et al., 2021). Site variation was modeled using fixed effects, which we have shown in prior work provides relatively good performance (Kia et al., 2021), although random effects for site may provide additional flexibility at higher computational cost. A fast numerical optimization algorithm was used to optimize hyperparameters (L-BFGS). Computational complexity of hyperparameter optimization was controlled by minimizing the negative log-likelihood. Deviation scores (Z-scores) are calculated for the n-th subject, and d-th brain area, in the test set as: (2) Znd=ynd−y^ndσd2+(σ∗2)d Where ynd is the true response, y^nd is the predicted mean, σd2 is the estimated noise variance (reflecting uncertainty in the data), and σ2d is the variance attributed to modeling uncertainty. Model fit for each brain region was evaluated by calculating the explained variance (which measures central tendency), the mean squared log-loss (MSLL, central tendency, and variance) plus skew and kurtosis of the deviation scores (2) which measures how well the shape of the regression function matches the data (Dinga et al., 2021). Note that for all models, we report out of sample metrics. To provide a summary of individual variation within each clinical group, deviation scores were summarized for each clinical group (Figure 2B–C) by first separating them into positive and negative deviations, counting how many subjects had an extreme deviation (positive extreme deviation defined as Z>2, negative extreme deviation as Z<−2) at a given ROI, and then dividing by the group size to show the percentage of individuals with extreme deviations at that brain area. Controls from the same sites as the patient groups were summarized in the same manner for comparison. We also performed classical case versus control group difference testing on the true data and on the deviation scores (Figure 2D) and thresholded results at a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate of p<0.05. Note that in both cases, we directly contrast each patient group to their matched controls to avoid nuisance variation confounding any reported effects (e.g., sampling characteristics and demographic differences). All pretrained models and code are shared online with straightforward directions for transferring to new sites and including an example transfer data set derived from several OpenNeuro.org data sets. Given a new set of data (e.g., sites not present in the training set), this is done by first applying the warp parameters estimating on the training data to the new data set, adjusting the mean and variance in the latent Gaussian space, then (if necessary) warping the adjusted data back to the original space, which is similar",,,,,Neuroimaging; Normative; Modalities; Computer science; Set (abstract data type); Population; Data science; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Medicine; Neuroscience; Social science; Philosophy; Environmental health; Epistemology; Sociology; Programming language,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.72904.sa2,,10.7554/elife.72904.sa2,,,0,,1,true,cc-by,gold

Andreasen; Peg Nopoulos; Stephan Arndt; Vincent A. Magnotta; Michael Flaum,"Background Many studies have shown that structural brain abnormalities in schizophrenia are already present by the time of index evaluation of first-episode patients. However, whether these abnormalities progressively worsen during the subsequent course of the disorder remains unresolved. Methods To study the longitudinal progression of structural brain abnormalities, high-resolution multispectral magnetic resonance images obtained on 73 recent-onset schizophrenic patients and 23 controls were analyzed using state-of-the-art, well-validated, and highly reliable neuroimaging tools. The mean duration between initial and follow-up MRIs was 3 years. Repeated-measures analysis of covariance was carried out to determine (1) whether brain volume changes differed between patients and controls and (2) the significance of regional brain changes on functional outcome in schizophrenia. Results We found accelerated enlargement in cortical sulcal cerebrospinal fluid spaces early in the course of schizophrenia. Instead of the usual trajectory of volume enlargement, patients showed progressive reduction in frontal lobe white matter volume. A reciprocal increase in frontal lobe cerebrospinal fluid volume also occurred at a more rapid rate in patients than in controls. In keeping with most of our a priori hypotheses, patients with poor outcome had greater lateral ventricular enlargement over time than patients with good outcome. Progressive decrement in frontal lobe white matter volume and enlargement in frontal lobe cerebrospinal fluid volume were associated with greater negative symptom severity. Reductions in frontal lobe gray and white matter volumes correlated with poorer executive functioning. Conclusions There are ongoing changes in the brains of schizophrenic patients during the initial years after diagnosis despite ongoing antipsychotic drug treatment. These progressive changes seem to be most evident in the frontal lobes and to correlate with functional impairment. Disruptions in neurodevelopment or neural plasticity may act alone or in combination to bring about these progressive brain deficits in schizophrenia.",60,6,585,594,Internal medicine; Magnetic resonance imaging; Psychology; Cardiology; Neuroscience; Frontal lobe; Grey matter; Psychosis; White matter; First episode; Neuroimaging; Brain size,,"Adult; Age of Onset; Antipsychotic Agents/pharmacology; Brain/anatomy & histology; Cerebral Ventricles/anatomy & histology; Disease Progression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Frontal Lobe/anatomy & histology; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/statistics & numerical data; Male; Neuronal Plasticity/drug effects; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Schizophrenia/diagnosis; Temporal Lobe/anatomy & histology",Antipsychotic Agents,NIMH NIH HHS (MH31593) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (MH40856) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (MH43271) United States,https://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Ho.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12796222 https://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=207544 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/articlepdf/207544/yoa20651.pdf https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207544 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12796222/ https://www.academia.edu/24979280/Progressive_Structural_Brain_Abnormalities_and_Their_Relationship_to_Clinical_Outcome,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archpsyc.60.6.585,12796222,10.1001/archpsyc.60.6.585,2100173716,,0,000-157-325-308-472; 000-923-757-971-665; 001-773-687-837-182; 003-312-543-923-605; 003-910-081-723-093; 004-878-263-418-021; 005-231-662-446-774; 006-392-332-796-337; 006-834-906-691-477; 006-899-297-210-849; 007-593-656-482-059; 007-834-705-581-083; 007-876-531-800-375; 008-973-409-571-450; 010-464-804-743-562; 010-952-688-691-373; 014-830-579-779-683; 016-854-449-216-101; 018-010-390-298-394; 019-157-671-039-893; 019-833-209-922-142; 020-422-496-010-240; 022-621-018-910-580; 023-608-961-022-39X; 027-204-050-265-731; 027-345-457-709-778; 027-963-479-689-702; 030-220-386-866-563; 030-773-828-225-094; 030-940-247-412-989; 032-672-602-981-217; 032-946-921-888-605; 034-187-466-684-165; 034-846-973-402-501; 035-123-923-952-991; 035-418-686-555-56X; 039-783-231-865-642; 041-128-438-021-229; 042-822-363-651-897; 043-643-878-092-281; 045-624-971-549-951; 045-762-004-243-477; 046-081-067-499-018; 046-666-474-946-026; 049-303-773-075-781; 050-616-057-638-013; 053-821-391-435-264; 053-896-916-659-567; 053-950-735-183-71X; 054-433-928-616-05X; 055-908-153-111-592; 058-685-672-709-24X; 059-041-694-395-31X; 060-352-910-502-17X; 061-978-705-907-021; 065-748-021-848-210; 066-068-305-506-332; 066-184-790-800-129; 073-776-025-136-614; 075-825-259-287-176; 080-219-983-523-740; 081-285-085-432-849; 081-397-495-387-645; 083-869-786-387-990; 089-161-519-736-812; 097-895-645-034-806; 104-132-203-243-957; 104-276-247-278-038; 104-295-718-870-315; 105-266-772-653-884; 115-720-527-508-771; 116-646-110-224-072; 116-815-186-419-110; 119-469-961-019-768; 123-375-295-110-486; 128-476-164-453-002; 139-181-641-488-955,531,true,,bronze

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is commonly used for the clinical diagnosis of dementia by identifying cerebral atrophy and structural alterations. Furthermore, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) can detect biochemical abnormalities in dementia patients, which may be beneficial for early diagnosis and treatment.  Aim: To provide a comprehensive protocol and a guidance tool for radiologists to effectively diagnose dementia and its subtypes {Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), frontotemporal lobe dementia, etc.} based on radiological findings coupled with volumetry, spectroscopy, and Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL) findings.  Materials and Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Radiology, Nanavati Max Superspeciality Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, between June 2022 and June 2023. A total of 125 patients were analysed to observe the correlation between whole brain volume, Intracranial Volume (ICV) of different cortical regions, hippocampal atrophy, and MRS findings. Descriptive statistics were used, and results were expressed as means and standard deviations for continuous variables, and as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.  Results: Out of 125 patients, 71 (56.8%) were males, and 54 (43.2%) were females, with ages ranging from 41 to 96 years. The majority presented with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) 36 patients (28.8%) and Vascular Dementia (VaD) (18 patients - 14.4%). Some clinical features and imaging findings overlapped, resulting in some cases being a combination of different types of dementia. MRI, MRS, and Medial Temporal Atrophy (MTA) played a crucial role in allowing clinicians to perform a differential diagnosis.  Conclusion: The use of MR volumetry and spectroscopy aids in classifying the type of dementia, which, in turn, gives treating clinicians a better perspective for further treatment and its outcomes.</jats:p>",,,,,Dementia; Medicine; Cohort; Retrospective cohort study; Internal medicine; Disease,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.7860/jcdr/2024/67220.19055,,10.7860/jcdr/2024/67220.19055,,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

Modrego; Gracián García-Martí; Roberto Sanz-Requena; Luis Martí-Bonmatí,"Abstract Objective To assess the accuracy of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and brain volumetry in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to predict conversion to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods Forty-eight patients fulfilling the criteria of amnestic MCI who underwent a conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by MRS, and T1-3D on 1.5 Tesla MR unit. At baseline the patients underwent neuropsychological examination. 1H-MRS of the brain was carried out by exploring the left medial occipital lobe and ventral posterior cingulated cortex (vPCC) using the LCModel software. A high resolution T1-3D sequence was acquired to carry out the volumetric measurement. A cortical and subcortical parcellation strategy was used to obtain the volumes of each area within the brain. The patients were followed up to detect conversion to probable AD. Results After a 3-year follow-up, 15 (31.2%) patients converted to AD. The myo-inositol in the occipital cortex and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) in the posterior cingulate cortex predicted conversion to probable AD at 46.1% sensitivity and 90.6% specificity. The positive predictive value was 66.7%, and the negative predictive value was 80.6%, with an overall cross-validated classification accuracy of 77.8%. The volume of the third ventricle, the total white matter and entorhinal cortex predict conversion to probable AD at 46.7% sensitivity and 90.9% specificity. The positive predictive value was 70%, and the negative predictive value was 78.9%, with an overall cross-validated classification accuracy of 77.1%. Combining volumetric measures in addition to the MRS measures the prediction to probable AD has a 38.5% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity, with a positive predictive value of 55.6%, a negative predictive value of 77.8% and an overall accuracy of 73.3%. Conclusion Either MRS or brain volumetric measures are markers separately of cognitive decline and may serve as a noninvasive tool to monitor cognitive changes and progression to dementia in patients with amnestic MCI, but the results do not support the routine use in the clinical settings.",38,,27,32,Neuropsychology; Pathology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Occipital lobe; Posterior cingulate; Entorhinal cortex; White matter; Cognitive decline; Nuclear medicine; Brain mapping; Medicine,Alzheimer's disease; Brain volumetry; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Mild cognitive impairment,Aged; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Brain Mapping/methods; Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnostic imaging; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/methods; Male; Organ Size; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27964994/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27964994 http://zaguan.unizar.es/record/79361/files/texto_completo.pdf https://zaguan.unizar.es/record/79361/files/texto_completo.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0730725X16302545 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27964994 https://zaguan.unizar.es/record/79361,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mri.2016.12.010,27964994,10.1016/j.mri.2016.12.010,2560254344,,0,000-961-842-508-189; 002-129-629-862-32X; 002-165-841-899-929; 002-301-149-850-866; 002-713-974-180-445; 003-953-509-664-996; 009-090-395-443-163; 009-440-833-107-846; 010-881-767-805-88X; 016-205-154-194-531; 018-355-117-992-493; 019-910-183-578-676; 020-798-450-711-581; 023-303-791-452-698; 023-795-290-727-941; 028-439-266-248-140; 030-005-258-357-930; 032-129-513-254-072; 034-357-653-471-252; 035-849-966-791-588; 038-320-283-586-373; 040-213-530-030-662; 041-280-882-219-369; 042-129-013-823-622; 048-382-290-214-62X; 048-536-112-681-339; 050-732-798-758-619; 052-013-750-492-585; 052-406-053-415-450; 052-563-437-040-263; 054-203-464-972-588; 057-087-115-857-307; 059-224-826-572-376; 060-516-213-289-64X; 066-772-054-284-817; 066-987-695-293-607; 070-794-199-088-448; 078-565-889-895-53X; 083-515-313-522-584; 090-343-306-623-788; 101-619-456-145-285; 103-697-049-941-184; 106-625-401-465-436; 125-200-548-481-516; 143-037-591-297-891,11,true,cc-by-nc-nd,green

K. Agrawal,"The classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment can be done using 2-D CNN, which take a single slice at a time as input and do not consider pixel information from adjacent slices or spatial correlation amongst the slices of the brain volume or 3-D CNN, which requires huge computation time and memory as a significantly large number of parameters involved in 3D-CNN in comparison to 2D-CNN. To reduce the spatial correlation, computational complexity, and memory requirement, we use t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) on MRI volume to reduce its dimensions. Also, we use parallel CNN instead of sequential to analyze MRI volumes and a combination of RELU, sigmoid, and SIREN activation functions to learn better features for the classification of MCI. To check the efficacy of the proposed t-SNE Multiple-Activation Parallel Convolution Network, experiments are performed on publicly available Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, and performance is compared with existing methods. We obtain classification accuracy of 94.15 and 94.89 on MCI-C Vs. MCI-NC data and MCI Vs.

METHODS 23 patients with (AD and 23 sex, age, and educational background-matched normal controls (NC group) underwent three-dimensional MRI to measure the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex (EC), perirhinal cortex (PC), cornu temporale, and uncus distance in the baseline survey. Two years later 10 AD patients and 11 normal controls underwent 3-D MRI once again in the follow-up survey. RESULTS The baseline survey showed that the levels of uncus distance and total temporal horn volume of the ADS patients were 11 +/- 4 and 1.21 +/- 1.00 respectively, both significantly higher than those of the NC group (7 +/- 3 and 0.59 +/- 0.54 respectively, P < 0.01, P < 0.05), and the levels of total entorhinal cortex volume, total perirhinal cortex volume, and total hippocampus volume were 2.52 +/- 0.86, 2.19 +/- 0.62, and 3.23 +/- 0.75 respectively, all significantly lower than those of the BC group (3.67 +/- 0.54, 3.39 +/- 0.51, and 3.98 0.38, all P < 0.01). The levels of uncus distance and total temporal horn volume of the AD patients during the follow-up survey were 11 +/- 4 and 1.21 +/- 1.00 respectively, both significantly higher than those of the NC group (7 +/- 3 and 0.59 +/- 0.54 respectively, both P < 0.05); and the total entorhinal cortex volume, total perirhinal cortex volume, and total hippocampus volume of the AD patients during the followup survey were. 1.79 +/- 0.56, 1.77 +/- 0.59, and 2.80 +/- 0.80 respectively, all significantly lower than those of the NC group (2.76 +/- 0.50, 2.76 +/- 0.41, and 3.59 +/- 0.38 respectively, all P < 0.01). CONCLUSION The AD patients have more remarkable atrophy of entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and have obvious extension of cornu temporale and uncus distance in comparison with the normal controls. The shrinkage rate of hippocampus can be used as a marker for the diagnosis and progress of AD.",88,15,1027,1031,Internal medicine; Endocrinology; Case-control study; Perirhinal cortex; Amygdala; Uncus; Entorhinal cortex; Hippocampus; Atrophy; Brain size; Medicine,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease/pathology; Amygdala/pathology; Brain/pathology; Case-Control Studies; Cerebral Cortex/pathology; Entorhinal Cortex/pathology; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hippocampus/pathology; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies",,,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/18754434 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18754434,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18754434,18754434,,2434811862,,0,,0,false,,

This study aimed to identify the shared and distinct atrophy patterns between patients specified by SCD plus and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, a prodromal stage of AD) and to investigate the extent that automated brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetry can differentiate patients with SCD from normal control (NC) participants and patients with aMCI. We acquired structural MRI brain scans from 44 patients with aMCI, 40 patients with SCD (who met the major criteria of SCD plus), and 48 NC participants. Automatic brain segmentation was performed to quantify the volumetric measures of cognitive-relevant areas. These volumetric measures were compared across the 3 groups with analysis of variance. In addition, we performed support vector machine analyses using volumetric measures of single regions or multiple regions to further evaluate the sensitivity of automated brain volumetry in differentiating a specific group from another. The atrophy patterns in patients with aMCI and SCD were similar. Using the regional volumetric measures, we achieved high performance in differentiating aMCI and SCD from NCs (average classification accuracy [ACC] > 90%). However, the performance was not ideal when differentiating aMCI from SCD (ACC < 63%). In conclusion, patients with SCD specified by SCD plus presented similar atrophy patterns as patients with aMCI, which was distinguishable from NC participants. Future studies should aim to associate the atrophy patterns of SCD with possible conversion to aMCI or AD in a longitudinal design.",32,6,354,364,Internal medicine; Magnetic resonance imaging; Cardiology; Disease; Atrophy; Brain segmentation; Cognitive decline; Normal aging; Alzheimer's disease; Medicine; Analysis of variance,Alzheimer disease; amnestic mild cognitive impairment; brain volumetry; magnetic resonance imaging; subjective cognitive decline,Aged; Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis; Brain/pathology; Cognitive Dysfunction/pathology; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging,,Beijing Nature Science Foundation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31480984/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480984 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891988719862637 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0891988719862637,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891988719862637,31480984,10.1177/0891988719862637,2972204154,,0,000-936-601-775-361; 005-179-208-583-706; 007-031-344-087-266; 007-857-089-920-599; 009-967-758-021-524; 010-514-040-963-145; 012-254-415-967-420; 016-198-841-742-293; 018-602-681-726-749; 023-176-304-540-481; 023-928-444-110-407; 024-641-890-533-475; 024-915-754-540-385; 027-966-911-488-429; 030-879-957-630-446; 031-363-627-347-620; 031-918-254-698-861; 034-022-717-896-942; 034-125-566-465-337; 034-165-716-455-756; 034-888-143-735-492; 035-966-380-422-753; 040-213-530-030-662; 041-665-995-297-707; 042-508-095-450-275; 046-255-929-301-069; 051-641-730-685-161; 059-086-984-559-078; 059-786-079-109-47X; 060-350-822-052-560; 063-733-427-247-648; 069-124-835-287-117; 075-349-583-490-315; 084-119-212-139-860; 085-785-841-111-423; 100-441-262-905-440; 101-763-399-168-486; 123-093-180-402-176; 132-005-614-865-025; 139-311-867-879-564; 142-061-461-530-513,25,false,,

Black,"Background Hypertension is an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral small vessel disease. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are common anti-hypertensive treatments, but have differential effects on cortical amyloid. Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between anti-hypertensive treatment, brain volume, and cognition, using a propensity-weighted analysis to account for confounding by indication. Methods We identified a cohort of normal elderly adults and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD (N = 886; mean age = 75.0) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Primary outcomes were brain parenchymal fraction, total hippocampal volume, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume. Secondary outcomes were standardized scores on neuropsychological tests. Propensity-weighted adjusted multivariate linear regression was used to estimate associations between anti-hypertensive treatment class and MRI volumes and cognition. Results Individuals treated with ARBs showed larger hippocampal volumes (R2 = 0.83, p = 0.05) and brain parenchymal fraction (R2 = 0.83, p = 0.01) than those treated with ACEIs. When stratified by diagnosis, this effect remained only in normal elderly adults and MCI patients, and a significant association between ARBs and lower WMH volume (R2 = 0.83, p = 0.03) emerged for AD patients only. ARBs were also associated with significantly better performance on tests of episodic and verbal memory, language, and executive function (all p Conclusions Findings are consistent with evidence for a neuroprotective effect of treatment with ARBs for brain structure and cognition.

There were 623 cognitively normal and 65 SI Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants (age 55–92 years) enrolled in the neuroimaging substudy from 1994 to 2015. Mixed-effects regression was used to assess the associations of AD risk factors (age, APOE e4 carrier status, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, current smoking, and elevated cholesterol) with brain regional volume change among the overall sample and by diagnostic status. Older age, APOE e4 carrier status, hypertension, and HDL cholesterol were predictors of volumetric change. Among SI participants only, hypertension, obesity, and APOE e4 carrier status were associated with greater declines in selected brain regions. SI individuals in the preclinical AD stage are vulnerable to risk factors that have either a protective or null effect in cognitively normal individuals.",75,,178,186,Internal medicine; Neurodegeneration; Longitudinal study; Cholesterol; Disease; Obesity; Diabetes mellitus; Neuroimaging; Brain size; Medicine,Cardiovascular risk factors; Cognitive impairment; Neurodegeneration,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging/physiology; Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis; Amyloid beta-Peptides/metabolism; Brain/metabolism; Cognition/physiology; Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnosis; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging/methods",Amyloid beta-Peptides,NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG066507) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG005146) United States; Intramural NIH HHS (Z99 AG999999) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG014971) United States; NIA NIH HHS (RF1 AG054409) United States; NIH HHS (S10 OD023495) United States,https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC6394867 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6394867 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458018303889 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580127 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30580127/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2018.10.024,30580127,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2018.10.024,2899253786,PMC6394867,0,000-113-189-160-893; 000-933-962-041-44X; 001-363-163-587-838; 001-853-565-456-357; 002-176-204-846-502; 002-334-507-293-678; 003-226-254-486-786; 004-492-791-894-660; 006-220-795-358-949; 007-965-698-239-49X; 008-015-841-750-336; 009-590-041-957-272; 010-884-978-734-229; 011-407-892-996-556; 015-939-506-493-890; 023-076-087-601-429; 023-861-155-419-172; 024-976-928-100-62X; 025-011-955-529-478; 028-092-465-067-692; 034-089-325-226-591; 035-210-057-898-188; 038-830-711-556-171; 038-916-187-719-014; 044-001-468-239-81X; 047-426-047-421-683; 048-882-633-608-374; 053-251-149-319-845; 069-468-849-212-668; 069-570-589-924-52X; 074-887-470-115-481; 077-273-307-091-97X; 101-619-456-145-285; 105-790-989-628-47X; 123-093-180-402-176; 129-000-904-596-942,38,true,,green

Howes,"Introduction Structural MRI is the most frequently used method to investigate brain volume alterations in neuropsychiatric disease. Previous meta-analyses have typically focused on a single diagnosis, thereby precluding transdiagnostic comparisons. Methods and analysis We will include all structural MRI studies of adults that report brain volumes for participants from at least two of the following diagnostic groups: healthy controls, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, psychotic depression, clinical high risk for psychosis, schizotypal personality disorder, psychosis unspecified, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, emotionally unstable personality disorder, 22q11 deletion syndrome, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, mixed anxiety and depression. Network meta-analysis will be used to synthesise eligible studies. The primary analysis will examine standardised mean difference in average volume, a secondary analysis will examine differences in variability of volumes. Discussion This network meta-analysis will provide a transdiagnostic integration of structural neuroimaging studies, providing researchers with a valuable summary of a large literature.

It is defined as memory performance that is consistent with age-matched peers but significantly lower than younger adults. However, there is mounting evidence that AAMI may not be characteristic of healthy aging but is instead a harbinger of future cognitive decline and eventual development of dementia. We examined and compared the longitudinal progression of brain volume changes between individuals with AAMI and normal cognition. 151 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who were initially diagnosed with normal cognition (NC) and had MRI scans at baseline and 2-year follow-up were included in the present study. Baseline performance on the delayed recall trial of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) was examined, and individuals who scored more than 1 standard deviation (SD) below the mean established for young adults (ages 20-29) were reclassified as having AAMI. Ninety subjects met criteria for AAMI while 61 subjects remained in the NC group. Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) was used to create 3D Jacobian maps of local brain atrophy rates for individual participants; these spatially detailed 3D maps were compared between the two groups. Regional analyses were performed and direct comparisons of the Jacobian maps revealed that the AAMI group demonstrated significantly greater longitudinal atrophy in the right frontal and right temporal lobes as well as the anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus relative to the NC group (p<0.05; corrected for multiple comparisons using permutation tests). In contrast, the NC group did not show any area of greater brain volume loss relative to the AAMI group. The diagnosis of AAMI was associated with increased rate of brain atrophy relative to NC subjects in regions that are affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AAMI may be diagnostically useful in identifying individuals with early signs of underlying pathology who may be in the prodromal stages of AD.",7,4S_Part_6,,,Psychology; Audiology; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; Dementia; Atrophy; Cognition; Neuroimaging; Cognitive decline; Cognitive impairment; Neuroscience; Medicine; Internal medicine; Disease,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1016/j.jalz.2011.05.605 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2011.05.605,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2011.05.605,,10.1016/j.jalz.2011.05.605,,,0,,1,true,,bronze

006-933-482-726-907,Baseline Cognition Is the Best Predictor of 4-year Cognitive Change in Cognitively Intact Older Adults,2021-04-07,2021,journal article,Alzheimer's research & therapy,17589193,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,United Kingdom,Jolien Schaeverbeke; Silvy Gabel; Karen Meersmans; Emma Susanne Luckett; Steffi De Meyer; Katarzyna Adamczuk; Natalie Nelissen; Valerie Goovaerts; Ahmed Radwan; Stefan Sunaert; Patrick Dupont; Koen Van Laere; Rik Vandenberghe,"We examined in cognitively intact older adults the relative weight of cognitive, genetic, structural and amyloid brain imaging variables for predicting cognitive change over a 4-year time course. One hundred-eighty community-recruited cognitively intact older adults (mean age 68 years, range 52–80 years, 81 women) belonging to the Flemish Prevent Alzheimer’s Disease Cohort KU Leuven (F-PACK) longitudinal observational cohort underwent a baseline evaluation consisting of detailed cognitive assessment, structural MRI and 18F-flutemetamol PET. At inclusion, subjects were stratified based on Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) val66met polymorphism according to a factorial design. At inclusion, 15% were amyloid-PET positive (Centiloid >23.4). All subjects underwent 2-yearly follow-up of cognitive performance for a 4-year time period. Baseline cognitive scores were analysed using factor analysis. The slope of cognitive change over time was modelled using latent growth curve analysis. Using correlation analysis, hierarchical regression and mediation analysis, we examined the effect of demographic (age, sex, education) and genetic variables, baseline cognition, MRI volumetric (both voxelwise and region-based) as well as amyloid imaging measures on the longitudinal slope of cognitive change. A base model of age and sex explained 18.5% of variance in episodic memory decline. This increased to 41.6% by adding baseline episodic memory scores. Adding amyloid load or volumetric measures explained only a negligible additional amount of variance (increase to 42.2%). A mediation analysis indicated that the effect of age on episodic memory scores was partly direct and partly mediated via hippocampal volume. Amyloid load did not play a significant role as mediator between age, hippocampal volume and episodic memory decline. In cognitively intact older adults, the strongest baseline predictor of subsequent episodic memory decline was the baseline episodic memory score. When this score was included, only very limited explanatory power was added by brain volume or amyloid load measures. The data warn against classifications that are purely biomarker-based and highlight the value of baseline cognitive performance levels in predictive models.",13,1,75,75,Cognition; Effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance; Cognitive decline; Ageing; Audiology; Mediation (statistics); Brain size; Medicine; Cohort; Episodic memory,Ageing; Alzheimer’s disease; Cognitive decline; Mediation; Preclinical,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnostic imaging; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Positron-Emission Tomography",Amyloid beta-Peptides,"Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek; Onderzoeksraad, KU Leuven; Stichting Alzheimer Onderzoek; Vlaams Agentschap voor Onderzoek en Innovatie",https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-021-00798-4 https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-125104/v1.pdf?c=1607733123000 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13195-021-00798-4.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13195-021-00798-4 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8028179/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33827690 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33827690/ https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-125104/v1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13195-021-00798-4,33827690,10.1186/s13195-021-00798-4,3116768774,PMC8028179,0,000-738-571-347-544; 001-734-368-863-568; 003-248-637-497-498; 003-254-814-420-987; 003-401-522-968-032; 004-474-494-865-717; 007-042-092-181-558; 007-708-058-433-078; 009-892-341-967-556; 011-191-820-126-906; 011-707-747-218-832; 012-085-241-879-935; 012-488-581-378-818; 012-998-325-766-248; 013-519-661-451-398; 013-847-688-837-904; 014-804-344-222-929; 016-781-011-490-187; 016-889-714-751-384; 018-467-075-809-756; 018-518-073-817-08X; 018-755-660-274-023; 019-632-747-664-565; 022-314-710-945-624; 022-988-712-445-94X; 024-780-867-969-027; 024-997-752-988-612; 025-628-341-363-450; 025-724-556-647-792; 027-485-993-851-465; 030-314-209-679-852; 031-479-843-298-231; 033-620-120-989-576; 034-133-426-022-569; 035-797-114-234-544; 038-695-280-115-745; 043-257-891-182-85X; 049-230-686-228-036; 049-884-241-232-983; 053-921-958-296-321; 057-695-179-568-124; 060-054-595-998-906; 060-059-728-616-864; 070-582-820-034-006; 072-610-588-056-89X; 074-162-251-714-953; 078-772-563-185-628; 078-821-465-894-074; 080-536-783-264-43X; 086-072-926-432-652; 087-545-297-289-85X; 090-824-728-490-644; 091-229-181-275-675; 094-697-152-460-413; 100-386-155-391-14X; 100-452-701-901-796; 101-916-539-501-100; 104-514-757-305-404; 106-257-598-518-303; 118-686-686-936-24X; 119-072-449-400-441; 119-981-517-591-066; 131-309-462-583-489; 132-859-023-865-612; 133-352-462-606-253; 137-431-412-265-244; 161-925-419-587-502; 167-275-555-617-549,29,true,"CC BY, CC0",gold

Bressan; Andrea Parolin Jackowski,"Objective Several studies have shown cortical volume loss in frontotemporal regions in schizophrenia patients, and it is known that these reductions may be associated with disease symptoms and cognitive deficits. The aim of this study was to investigate possible cortical thickness correlations in frontotemporal regions in relation to age at onset and duration of illness. Methods One hundred forty-eight schizophrenia patients (97 males; age and SD 36.30 ± 10.06) and 87 (57 males; age and SD 36.48 ± 10.10) age-matched healthy subjects underwent a brain MRI scan. Cortical segmentation and surface statistical analysis were performed using the FreeSurfer software package. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Monte Carlo method considering a cluster-corrected Type I Error of 5%. Results Compared to controls, schizophrenia patients presented significant cortical thinning in the frontotemporal, parietal, and occipital cortices. No correlation between prefrontal cortex thickness and duration of illness in patients with schizophrenia or between frontotemporal cortical thickness and age at onset was found. However, a significant interaction between age and diagnosis was observed on frontal cortical thickness with patients presenting a thinner cortex than expected for age. Conclusion Although there was no correlation between age of onset and duration of illness with brain volume, our findings suggest that there is an accelerated cortical loss in schizophrenia, thus reinforcing the progressive processes of the disease.",18,6,315,321,Psychiatry; Internal medicine; Cardiology; Young adult; Frontal lobe; Cortex (anatomy); Age of onset; Prefrontal cortex; Brain mapping; Brain size; Medicine; Schizophrenia,,"Adolescent; Adult; Age of Onset; Aged; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex/pathology; Cognition Disorders/etiology; Disease Progression; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Schizophrenia/complications; Young Adult",,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23739259/ https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S1092852913000333 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cns-spectrums/article/is-there-an-association-between-cortical-thickness-age-of-onset-and-duration-of-illness-in-schizophrenia/419637572AE833E4BCC83499B4963B81 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23739259 http://www.repositorio.unifesp.br/handle/11600/37050,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1092852913000333,23739259,10.1017/s1092852913000333,2068100452,,0,000-923-757-971-665; 005-884-147-863-790; 011-458-550-218-64X; 012-105-228-374-903; 013-614-087-882-518; 015-965-016-200-601; 024-722-905-129-948; 027-650-371-539-078; 027-873-847-790-523; 028-453-017-670-296; 028-460-347-664-871; 030-940-247-412-989; 031-818-054-450-257; 039-294-516-360-579; 040-714-759-904-941; 040-961-617-886-336; 046-943-573-713-503; 047-075-900-570-503; 056-358-415-332-305; 060-472-398-554-427; 065-411-794-526-308; 066-761-349-166-718; 070-768-966-758-58X; 076-853-730-012-954; 086-113-048-322-270; 088-233-021-825-539; 090-812-504-226-360; 091-388-073-208-625; 095-871-754-362-64X; 097-991-941-709-951; 098-762-170-984-468; 118-292-333-144-747; 149-408-420-231-896; 150-475-216-155-203; 165-750-888-206-825,18,false,,

Individually, however, these modalities tend to lack precision in both AD diagnosis and AD staging. A joint MRI-EEG approach that combines structural with functional information has the potential to overcome these limitations. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study systematically investigated the link between MRI and EEG markers and the global cognitive status in early AD. We hypothesized that the joint modalities would identify cognitive deficits with higher accuracy than the individual modalities. In a cohort of 111 AD patients, we combined MRI measures of cortical thickness and regional brain volume with EEG measures of rhythmic activity, information processing and functional coupling in a generalized multiple regression model. Machine learning classification was used to evaluate the markers' utility in accurately separating the subjects according to their cognitive score. Results We found that joint measures of temporal volume, cortical thickness, and EEG slowing were well associated with the cognitive status and explained 38.2% of ifs variation. The inclusion of the covariates age, sex, and education considerably improved the model. The joint markers separated the subjects with an accuracy of 84.7%, which was considerably higher than by using individual modalities. Conclusions These results suggest that including joint MRI-EEG markers may be beneficial in the diagnostic workup, thus allowing for adequate treatment. Further studies in larger populations, with a longitudinal design and validated against functional-metabolic imaging are warranted to confirm the results.",9,1,e01197,,Magnetic resonance imaging; Cognition; Modalities; Alzheimer's disease; Electroencephalography; Neuroimaging; Brain size; Medicine; Cohort; Physical medicine and rehabilitation,Alzheimer disease; cognition; electroencephalography; magnetic resonance imaging,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging; Biomarkers; Cognition/physiology; Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnostic imaging; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuroimaging/methods",Biomarkers,Austrian Science Fund FWF (J 3766) Austria,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30592179/ https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/brb3.1197 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/brb3.1197 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30592179 http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/neuroimaging-markers-of-global-cognition-in-early-alzheimers-disease-a-magnetic-resonance-imagingelectroencephalography-study(71814611-d83f-43be-bb74-122ab189b531).html https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/neuroimaging-markers-of-global-cognition-in-early-alzheimers-disease-a-magnetic-resonance-imagingelectroencephalography-study(71814611-d83f-43be-bb74-122ab189b531).html https://orbit.dtu.dk/files/164317229/Waser_et_al_2018_Brain_and_Behavior.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592179 https://core.ac.uk/download/189891279.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1197,30592179,10.1002/brb3.1197,2908390113,PMC6346656,0,001-189-147-584-257; 001-642-927-716-890; 002-635-747-195-769; 002-814-170-465-181; 003-703-084-395-900; 004-224-174-122-39X; 006-990-145-159-076; 007-302-077-131-753; 007-890-627-797-976; 008-959-538-369-311; 010-924-057-349-557; 010-981-380-640-070; 011-675-320-131-638; 012-576-744-148-313; 012-666-764-097-428; 012-797-501-343-850; 015-419-443-690-731; 016-166-694-249-290; 016-725-066-978-925; 016-820-677-655-071; 019-491-441-744-822; 020-798-450-711-581; 021-047-409-056-748; 022-988-712-445-94X; 024-249-195-713-611; 024-656-569-089-488; 025-065-928-693-823; 025-921-219-887-720; 027-336-976-002-905; 027-677-522-739-510; 027-864-297-829-467; 028-190-516-681-238; 028-599-342-826-727; 031-818-054-450-257; 031-944-792-365-940; 033-253-770-689-477; 033-620-120-989-576; 035-408-710-879-945; 035-666-971-916-400; 036-267-399-391-540; 037-171-067-867-493; 037-286-667-567-558; 038-151-603-793-538; 040-714-759-904-941; 041-359-764-974-699; 043-620-913-216-293; 044-113-645-945-421; 046-263-082-975-278; 047-657-718-363-241; 048-437-100-709-062; 048-536-112-681-339; 049-884-241-232-983; 052-232-055-158-243; 052-690-172-487-095; 054-656-748-915-472; 059-630-153-787-308; 059-786-079-109-47X; 062-401-638-633-584; 065-912-364-300-611; 066-521-473-988-257; 066-663-458-967-267; 068-677-732-465-551; 071-133-879-344-247; 073-570-942-325-267; 075-156-334-167-33X; 077-273-307-091-97X; 078-661-934-444-202; 079-424-770-366-056; 079-464-276-519-332; 079-934-697-202-361; 080-145-972-860-398; 082-146-278-760-351; 085-198-825-592-451; 087-626-944-905-589; 091-910-518-177-390; 094-516-751-029-590; 095-455-937-190-024; 095-783-296-929-951; 096-445-257-283-128; 097-485-318-728-585; 107-012-094-054-18X; 116-213-991-702-519; 120-656-052-673-251; 122-044-639-024-643; 122-188-949-919-218; 125-941-957-989-036; 131-423-542-523-282; 132-973-380-822-126; 138-584-668-212-289; 144-357-353-982-243; 156-236-539-696-565; 178-047-014-882-854; 196-704-165-565-178,22,true,cc-by,gold

Structural MRI studies and functional studies using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are widely used in diagnosis of AD. Outstanding progress in diagnostic accuracy of these neuroimaging modalities has been obtained using statistical analysis on a voxel-by-voxel basis after spatial normalization of individual scans to a standardized brain-volume template instead of visual inspection or a conventional region of interest technique. In a very early stage of AD, this statistical approach revealed gray matter loss in the entorhinal and hippocampal areas and hypometabolism or hypoperfusion in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. These two findings might be related in view of anatomical knowledge that the regions are linked through the circuit of Papez. This statistical approach also offers prediction of conversion from MCI to AD. Presence of hypometabolism or hypoperfusion in parietal association areas and entorhinal atrophy at the MCI stage has been reported to predict rapid conversion to AD.",27,6,570,577,Spatial normalization; Neuroscience; Positron emission tomography; Emission computed tomography; Posterior cingulate; Dementia; Precuneus; Prodromal Stage; Neuroimaging; Medicine,,"Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis; Cognition Disorders/diagnosis; Diagnostic Imaging/methods; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",,,http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/10021237031 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1789.2007.00794.x https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18021379 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18021379/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1789.2007.00794.x,18021379,10.1111/j.1440-1789.2007.00794.x,2058608956,,0,000-379-052-963-642; 001-614-126-238-747; 001-872-284-893-001; 002-685-028-307-010; 003-328-967-423-870; 003-841-796-239-936; 004-411-613-420-641; 004-772-459-688-837; 004-836-707-391-304; 005-448-061-000-280; 006-120-456-667-490; 006-186-136-684-680; 008-518-088-794-586; 010-437-091-845-484; 012-012-557-649-610; 013-254-719-429-329; 014-016-402-995-800; 014-586-330-391-50X; 015-120-808-394-219; 015-419-443-690-731; 015-467-427-248-43X; 020-695-767-165-441; 021-447-040-227-692; 022-555-150-248-464; 024-673-312-456-064; 026-639-308-701-681; 035-693-591-651-766; 036-806-351-008-506; 038-695-280-115-745; 039-385-134-728-861; 040-125-933-501-65X; 040-153-671-953-450; 041-659-814-887-273; 065-451-784-892-781; 065-638-782-492-135; 066-282-694-971-891; 071-302-202-665-350; 071-322-859-832-262; 073-072-590-717-547; 079-214-262-663-622; 090-710-285-074-530; 094-776-753-813-638; 105-383-074-770-605; 124-098-271-794-776; 126-497-147-381-094; 131-777-500-649-221; 170-552-268-223-863; 189-255-811-304-016,98,false,,

We aimed to study the use of hippocampal volume, entorhinal cortex (ERC) thickness, and whole brain volume (WBV) as predictors of cognitive change in patients with AD. 120 AD subjects, 106 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 99 non demented controls (NDC) from the multi-center pan-European AddNeuroMed study underwent MRI scanning at baseline and clinical evaluations at quarterly follow-up up to 1 year. The rate of cognitive decline was estimated using cognitive outcomes, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer disease assessment scale-cognitive (ADAS-cog) by fitting a random intercept and slope model. AD subjects had smaller ERC thickness and hippocampal and WBV volumes compared to MCI and NDC subjects. Within the AD group, ERC > WBV was significantly associated with baseline cognition (MMSE, ADAS-cog) and disease severity (Clinical Dementia Rating). Baseline ERC thickness was associated with both longitudinal MMSE and ADAS-cog score changes and WBV with ADAS-cog decline. These data indicate that AD subjects with thinner ERC had lower baseline cognitive scores, higher disease severity, and predicted greater subsequent cognitive decline at one year follow up. ERC is a region known to be affected early in the disease. Therefore, the rate of atrophy in this structure is expected to be higher since neurodegeneration begins earlier. Focusing on structural analyses that predict decline can identify those individuals at greatest risk for future cognitive loss. This may have potential for increasing the efficacy of early intervention.",33,3,755,766,Internal medicine; Pathology; Psychology; Cardiology; Cognition; Entorhinal cortex; Clinical Dementia Rating; Atrophy; Cognitive decline; Alzheimer's disease; Brain size; Biomarker (medicine),,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease/complications; Apolipoprotein E4/genetics; Cholinesterase Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Cognition Disorders/diagnosis; Entorhinal Cortex/pathology; Female; Hippocampus/pathology; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Status Schedule; Predictive Value of Tests; Statistics, Nonparametric",Apolipoprotein E4; Cholinesterase Inhibitors,,https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad121408 https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/622575 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23047370/ https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/publications/622575 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23047370,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/jad-2012-121408,23047370,10.3233/jad-2012-121408,1588839144,,0,000-237-235-476-296; 002-796-015-264-48X; 005-847-352-024-061; 005-884-147-863-790; 008-989-867-184-42X; 011-386-154-387-740; 011-789-131-714-506; 014-050-827-791-765; 014-118-390-880-949; 015-419-443-690-731; 017-757-809-268-557; 018-622-691-667-330; 020-798-450-711-581; 022-988-712-445-94X; 023-285-640-099-78X; 023-795-290-727-941; 025-921-219-887-720; 026-698-558-908-351; 028-454-417-537-093; 029-700-853-901-151; 030-033-427-011-50X; 030-898-702-580-022; 031-631-850-050-369; 031-709-287-661-124; 031-818-054-450-257; 032-672-959-113-981; 033-037-654-482-456; 033-283-940-337-042; 033-620-120-989-576; 036-806-351-008-506; 037-255-558-827-62X; 038-008-444-915-38X; 039-360-875-217-435; 040-213-530-030-662; 041-204-111-659-37X; 043-134-967-618-120; 044-837-344-106-978; 045-702-065-949-217; 048-536-112-681-339; 049-614-198-002-17X; 053-966-933-640-674; 055-779-066-831-198; 056-040-486-905-932; 057-354-684-669-609; 062-090-351-566-016; 062-455-628-306-911; 065-313-970-388-102; 066-541-292-495-064; 068-459-040-183-099; 069-245-013-350-093; 077-446-220-030-448; 078-828-996-463-128; 079-464-276-519-332; 080-145-972-860-398; 081-362-789-529-522; 081-770-307-806-295; 083-579-742-308-773; 083-877-327-214-759; 084-194-881-700-504; 089-014-295-999-217; 092-379-773-662-599; 094-113-701-647-036; 105-029-383-337-387; 105-417-621-524-503; 115-887-728-358-540; 120-229-920-774-487; 142-758-213-334-206; 149-241-361-074-250; 169-719-725-592-477; 174-990-232-788-198,120,true,,bronze
011-746-546-873-47X,Resolution of positive symptoms of schizophrenia after traumatic brain injury.,2014-09-18,2014,journal article,The primary care companion for CNS disorders,21557772; 21557780,"Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc",United States,Jay Brieler; Michael Del Core,"To the Editor: Recent advances in imaging technology have improved our understanding of schizophrenia but have fallen short of providing a definitive etiology. We describe a patient with persistent and debilitating psychotic symptoms that drastically improved after he was struck by a car and suffered massive head trauma.; ; Case report: Mr A is a 51-year-old black man with a long history of schizophrenia with severe and persistent symptoms including delusions of reference and persecution, paranoia, and disorganized speech. During exacerbations, he also experienced command auditory hallucinations and visual phenomena. His symptoms were remarkably consistent throughout hospital records that date back to 1989, including extended stays at a state mental facility. Available toxicology screens are negative, and there is no recorded history of alcohol or illicit drug abuse. A computed tomography (CT) scan of his head was normal in 2008. From 2008 to 2013, Mr A was treated in the authors’ community primary care clinic for comorbid hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Unfortunately, Mr A had very poor insight into his psychiatric disease and was chronically nonadherent to medication. During all visits, he was floridly psychotic with prominent delusions, rapid derailment, and paranoia. Attempts to convince him to accept antipsychotic medication were unsuccessful. While Mr A was not judged to be an imminent danger to himself or others, his untreated functional status was poor.; ; In June of 2012, Mr A was struck by a car while walking in the street near his home. He was transported to a local academic trauma center, where an initial CT scan of the head was consistent with massive parenchymal brain injury and cranial trauma. Findings included diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, diffuse axonal injury, a small left frontal subdural hematoma, and a right paratentorial subdural hematoma. Over the next week, his intracranial injuries evolved. Worsening cerebral edema on the right eventually caused a right to left midline shift and compression of the ventricles. Due to concern about evolving uncal herniation, a craniectomy was performed, leaving a large right frontal cranial defect. Pressure was successfully relieved, with midline structures and ventricles returning to their appropriate positions. After a prolonged hospital and rehabilitation stay, Mr A underwent a reconstruction in March of 2013 with bone flap of the cranial vault. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed significant encephalomalacia, which was most prominent in the right temporal and left frontal lobes. He has since returned to the community under the care of his mother and family.; ; Mr A returned to the primary care clinic in April of 2013. At that time, he was wheelchair bound with significant left-sided weakness. He exhibited spasticity of the upper extremities, along with ankylosis of the shoulders and elbows. His affect had flattened, and he had some delays in spontaneous speech. However, the delusional and paranoid content of his speech had essentially disappeared. Despite his profound motor sequelae, his speech was more coherent than prior to the accident. Both his mother and brother confirmed that there was a vast improvement in his psychosis and that many members of the community had noted the change as well. No evidence of hallucinations or delusions of reference had been reported since the accident. At that time, his only potentially psychoactive medication was levetiracetam given for seizures associated with the brain injury.; ; To further assess the improvement in his psychotic symptoms, Mr A and his mother were interviewed using items from the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS).1 This scale is divided into 4 categories of hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior, and positive formal thought disorder. The symptoms within each domain are rated from 0 (none) to 5 (severe). Mr A denied ever having any of the symptoms and scored all items on the SAPS as 0/5. His mother reported that the item for persecutory delusions had decreased from a 5/5 to 0/5. Her ratings of derailment decreased from 5/5 to 2/5 and illogicality from 4/5 to 2/5. Distractible speech decreased from 4/5 to 1/5.; ; MEDLINE searches using MeSH terms schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury revealed no cases of improvement in psychotic symptoms following closed head trauma. In fact, all of the literature we found, including a case review,2 a meta-analysis of case-controlled studies,3 and a chart-based case-control study,4 found a positive association between head trauma and the diagnosis of schizophrenia. There is also evidence that early injury during childhood has been related to the severity of psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia.5,6; ; Multiple studies have attempted to correlate anatomy with psychotic illness. The most consistent findings are enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles, along with general reduction in brain volume in the temporal and prefrontal lobes.7,8 More recently, a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies identified hypoactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hyperactivation of anterior cingulate gyrus in patients with schizophrenia.9 Other areas of study have included the superior temporal gyrus, the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, and the hippocampus.10; ; It is unclear what aspect of the traumatic brain injury was responsible for Mr A’s reduced positive symptoms of schizophrenia.

013-122-275-264-10X,Effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on hippocampal volume change in schizophrenia.,2010-08-19,2010,journal article,Hippocampus,10981063; 10509631,Wiley,United States,P. Cédric M. P. Koolschijn; Neeltje E.M. van Haren; Steven C. Bakker; Mechteld L.C. Hoogendoorn; Hilleke E. Hulshoff Pol; René S. Kahn,"A functional polymorphism of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene (Val66Met) has been associated with the risk for schizophrenia and volume differences in the hippocampus. However, little is known about the association between progressive brain volume change in schizophrenia and BDNF genotype. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between hippocampal volume change in patients with schizophrenia and healthy control subjects and BDNF genotype. Two structural magnetic resonance imaging brain scans were acquired of 68 patients with schizophrenia and 83 healthy subjects with an interval of approximately 5 yrs. Hippocampal volume change was measured and related to BDNF genotype in patients and healthy controls. BDNF genotype was not associated with hippocampal volume change over time in patients or healthy controls, nor could we replicate earlier findings on smaller hippocampal volume in Met-carriers. However, we did find a genotype-by-diagnosis interaction at baseline demonstrating smaller hippocampal volumes in patients homozygous for the Val-allele relative to healthy Val-homozygotes. In addition, irrespective of genotype, patients showed smaller hippocampal volumes compared with healthy controls at baseline. In summary, our results suggest that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is not associated with hippocampal volume change over time. Nevertheless, our findings may support the possibility that BDNF affects brain morphology differently in schizophrenia patients and healthy subjects. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",20,9,1010,1017,Genotype; Brain morphometry; Hippocampal formation; Psychology; Neurotrophic factors; Neuroscience; Brain-derived neurotrophic factor; Hippocampus; Brain size; Schizophrenia,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Amino Acid Substitution/genetics; Atrophy; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/genetics; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics; Hippocampus/pathology; Humans; Male; Methionine/genetics; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics; Schizophrenia/genetics; Valine/genetics; Young Adult",Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Methionine; Valine,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.20699 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/19714565 https://core.ac.uk/display/141608133,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hipo.20699,19714565,10.1002/hipo.20699,2084661664,,0,000-847-519-543-84X; 000-971-973-295-290; 002-391-809-691-859; 002-842-193-817-07X; 003-720-840-367-783; 004-418-925-961-406; 005-870-577-389-630; 005-971-193-556-148; 006-682-432-505-58X; 007-386-560-543-855; 009-277-168-214-862; 009-806-874-719-658; 010-730-740-148-981; 013-262-333-750-523; 013-565-596-426-512; 013-838-698-868-339; 015-222-138-628-123; 018-122-655-829-178; 018-204-144-923-524; 023-847-199-356-811; 026-091-561-891-529; 026-361-769-871-890; 027-174-540-015-765; 028-773-451-857-216; 029-863-397-708-847; 035-123-923-952-991; 036-399-219-626-811; 038-370-683-500-36X; 042-313-492-206-68X; 042-419-489-935-123; 046-442-897-010-497; 046-693-364-246-575; 046-943-573-713-503; 048-009-466-399-555; 050-564-480-922-343; 057-521-730-818-78X; 062-242-074-736-901; 065-710-472-633-418; 068-567-535-238-547; 069-868-922-773-633; 070-300-751-635-562; 072-559-946-310-253; 076-181-983-564-096; 081-673-717-802-153; 087-709-452-850-896; 091-388-073-208-625; 093-115-021-918-544; 096-826-546-453-516; 097-379-548-259-535; 098-284-810-712-732; 101-474-894-739-53X; 106-061-304-308-155; 106-482-081-267-733; 110-643-353-166-186; 111-158-203-082-451; 113-214-500-172-900; 113-772-866-350-552; 119-949-717-073-175; 122-378-809-352-552; 140-854-233-957-061; 143-890-002-110-661; 149-666-508-529-39X; 152-573-220-903-878; 161-925-419-587-502; 165-750-888-206-825,47,false,,

Alterations characterize it in the brain, leading to specific proteins' deposition. Alzheimer's disease produces a reduction in brain volume, which eventually leads to brain cell death. More than 70% are 75 years of age or older. Alzheimer's disease is estimated to impact 60–70 percent of the world's 55 million dementia patients. Researchers have uncovered many elements that may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease. Machine learning techniques have the potential to improve the diagnosis method for Alzheimer's disease dramatically. Deep learning algorithms have seen a lot of success in the field of medical image analysis in recent years. Yet, there has been little study into the use of deep learning algorithms for detecting and categorizing Alzheimer's disease. This paper presents a deep-learning model for identifying and classifying different types of Alzheimer's disease using brain MRI data. The data collection contains a total of 6400 photographs. There are 1279 photographs used for training and 5121 for testing purposes; in this case, data augmentation is also employed to diversify the dataset. A CNN-based transfer learning model named Inception V3 is used to create results in this work, and the outcomes are compared based on precision, recall, F1-Score, and accuracy. The model's total accuracy is 89%. The use of categorization in predicting Alzheimer's disease is precious to medical experts involved in the condition's treatment.",,,1,6,Disease; Categorization; Deep learning; Transfer of learning; Artificial intelligence; Dementia; Computer science; Machine learning; Recall; Alzheimer's disease; Medicine; Psychology; Pathology; Cognitive psychology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icdcece57866.2023.10151235,,10.1109/icdcece57866.2023.10151235,,,0,000-955-763-334-001; 004-345-147-977-836; 009-087-121-934-320; 009-215-120-039-790; 021-427-381-245-428; 025-487-029-937-521; 027-469-720-627-361; 036-150-968-541-467; 041-341-427-974-131; 043-348-573-940-487; 055-292-660-789-549; 061-669-584-243-10X; 066-586-631-013-322; 068-010-899-070-337; 089-645-303-614-737; 153-359-520-777-446; 175-398-558-545-341,5,false,,

Barbier; Tong Li; Philip C. Wong; Hanzhang Lu,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly individuals. According to the current biomarker framework for ""unbiased descriptive classification"", biomarkers of neurodegeneration, ""N"", constitute a critical component in the tri-category ""A/T/N"" system. Current biomarkers of neurodegeneration suffer from potential drawbacks such as requiring invasive lumbar puncture, involving ionizing radiation, or representing a late, irreversible marker. Recent human studies have suggested that reduced brain oxygen metabolism may be a new functional marker of neurodegeneration in AD, but the heterogeneity and the presence of mixed pathology in human patients did not allow a full understanding of the role of oxygen extraction and metabolism in AD. In this report, global brain oxygen metabolism and related physiological parameters were studied in two AD mouse models with relatively pure pathology, using advanced MRI techniques including T2 -relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) and phase contrast (PC) MRI. Additionally, regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was determined with pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling. Reduced global oxygen extraction fraction (by -18.7%, p = 0.008), unit-mass cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2 ) (by -17.4%, p = 0.04) and total CMRO2 (by -30.8%, p 0.05), suggesting normal vascular function. By contrast, in B6;SJL-Tg [APPSWE]2576Kha (APP) mice-referred to as the amyloid AD model-no brain volume reduction, as well as relatively intact brain oxygen extraction and metabolism, were found (p > 0.05). Consistent with the imaging data, behavioral measures of walking distance were impaired in Tau4RΔK mice (p = 0.004), but not in APP mice (p = 0.88). Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that noninvasive MRI measurement of brain oxygen metabolism may be a promising biomarker of neurodegeneration in AD.",34,9,e4568,,Pathology; Cerebral blood flow; Neurodegeneration; Disease; Dementia; Metabolism; Brain size; Medicine; Biomarker (medicine); Amyloid,Alzheimer's disease; TRUST; arterial spin labeling; cerebral blood flow; cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen; oxygen extraction fraction; phase contrast,"Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging; Amyloid/metabolism; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/metabolism; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Brain/metabolism; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Oxygen/metabolism; Spin Labels; tau Proteins/metabolism; Mice",Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Spin Labels; tau Proteins; Oxygen,NIH HHS (R01 NS106711) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (R01 NS106702) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R21 AG058413) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (R01 NS106711) United States; NIA NIH HHS (RF1 AG071515) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (R01 MH084021) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG064792) United States; NIH HHS (R21 AG058413) United States; NIH HHS (RF1 AG071515) United States; NIBIB NIH HHS (P41 EB015909) United States; NIH HHS (R01 MH084021) United States; NIH HHS (R01 AG064792) United States; NIH HHS (R01 NS106702) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34050996 http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34050996/ https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/brain-metabolism-in-tau-and-amyloid-mouse-models-of-alzheimers-di https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34050996/ https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/nbm.4568 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34050996,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4568,34050996,10.1002/nbm.4568,3165238287,PMC9574887,0,001-595-533-823-694; 002-506-567-901-522; 002-524-250-605-660; 003-267-986-208-782; 003-689-379-528-338; 006-722-723-000-788; 006-770-525-726-728; 008-022-870-833-988; 008-624-053-019-511; 009-215-120-039-790; 009-378-504-150-275; 010-219-333-260-96X; 010-581-655-034-158; 011-088-488-892-397; 013-369-899-259-645; 014-272-904-557-15X; 015-319-774-937-884; 016-877-358-989-901; 017-124-686-073-521; 019-364-910-480-726; 020-846-340-740-131; 021-445-755-407-823; 023-010-358-475-38X; 024-042-265-287-972; 024-780-867-969-027; 024-912-441-933-571; 025-083-452-883-662; 025-733-075-976-135; 028-774-883-420-514; 029-688-900-155-114; 030-882-522-819-255; 031-450-205-558-888; 033-741-984-443-950; 034-406-221-640-671; 035-528-859-174-050; 035-778-181-371-641; 041-102-117-498-725; 044-033-681-183-997; 049-497-198-864-52X; 049-550-393-546-738; 053-630-185-238-727; 054-364-342-362-498; 054-946-387-778-876; 058-270-614-600-006; 058-665-183-188-641; 063-713-458-248-493; 064-363-699-533-024; 067-549-975-913-432; 069-206-007-921-935; 069-310-921-224-98X; 070-717-111-374-089; 075-156-938-866-692; 076-216-544-965-776; 076-956-426-432-569; 077-856-556-256-557; 079-278-384-663-244; 080-349-978-000-035; 081-301-220-455-718; 082-148-736-339-038; 082-271-640-578-169; 084-302-196-744-942; 089-932-849-633-43X; 092-406-826-714-104; 099-201-414-221-528; 105-790-989-628-47X; 109-660-031-077-622; 111-043-690-853-830; 122-339-842-439-682; 127-437-691-337-603; 128-474-213-234-350; 136-852-124-442-452; 155-671-030-312-346; 172-307-599-715-639,17,true,,unknown

Corr; Dominic Fannon; Tonmoy Sharma,"Neuropsychological function-brain structure relationships may differ as a function of illness stage because of progressive brain matter loss through the course of schizophrenia. In this study, we tested whether neuropsychological function-brain structure relationships differed as a function of illness stage. In addition, we tested whether these relationships differed between older and young healthy controls. Function-structure relationships were examined in 35 first-episode patients (31 with schizophrenia, 4 with schizoaffective disorder), 54 chronic schizophrenia patients, 21 older healthy controls and 20 young healthy controls. MRI volumes of frontal and temporal lobe structures, as well as the whole brain, were estimated using a region-of-interest approach. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed between the MRI and neuropsychological measures. Stronger relationships of immediate memory-total prefrontal cortex (PFC) volume in chronic than first-episode patients, and in older than young controls were observed. The abstract reasoning (WCST perseverative errors)-total temporal lobe volume relationship was stronger in older than young controls. These function-structure relationships appeared unexplained by whole brain volume or age in chronic patients. A similar dissociation between young and older subjects of both healthy and patient groups suggests that a 'bigger-is-better' relationship style is present in older individuals regardless of a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",162,3,195,204,Psychiatry; Neuropsychology; Psychology; Neuropsychological test; Psychosis; Schizoaffective disorder; Temporal lobe; Diagnosis of schizophrenia; First episode; Brain size; Clinical psychology,,Adult; Brain/anatomy & histology; Chronic Disease; Cognition Disorders/diagnosis; Demography; Female; Hippocampus/anatomy & histology; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Phonetics; Psychotic Disorders/diagnosis; Schizophrenia/diagnosis; Severity of Illness Index; Verbal Behavior,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/18226505 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925492707001722 https://core.ac.uk/display/29892659 https://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/15990/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18226505 http://www.philipcorr.net/uploads/downloads/83.pdf https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/15826/ https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Preethi_Premkumar2/publication/5624379_Neuropsychological_function-brain_structure_relationships_and_stage_of_illness_An_investigation_into_chronic_and_first-episode_schizophrenia/links/00463517aacd7f1ef6000000.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pscychresns.2007.08.005,18226505,10.1016/j.pscychresns.2007.08.005,1985633719,,0,000-310-096-335-896; 007-834-705-581-083; 008-269-246-333-474; 009-380-558-784-110; 014-137-469-666-033; 014-653-497-583-770; 016-916-903-175-09X; 018-518-073-817-08X; 019-706-005-401-714; 020-422-496-010-240; 020-506-389-325-560; 022-241-157-293-194; 024-637-588-199-38X; 027-873-847-790-523; 029-761-908-977-604; 033-340-766-312-63X; 034-698-433-615-571; 038-933-655-632-388; 040-180-637-743-314; 041-128-438-021-229; 049-945-010-175-906; 052-068-470-155-945; 055-038-778-394-602; 057-951-430-439-614; 059-943-435-322-573; 065-411-794-526-308; 066-068-305-506-332; 067-259-906-805-07X; 075-532-803-445-803; 092-171-540-906-780; 097-115-735-372-016; 097-895-645-034-806; 099-978-985-587-825; 107-801-317-362-414; 116-815-186-419-110; 126-152-721-219-785; 138-918-533-018-70X; 142-028-380-207-162; 194-914-483-558-304,30,true,,green

Newberg; Elaine Souder; Jesse A. Berlin,"Average whole brain metabolic rates, when corrected for brain atrophy, are similar between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-matched controls. To elucidate the relationship between reduced cognitive function and cerebral metabolism in patients with AD, we hypothesized that the absolute amount of glucose used by the entire brain may prove to be a more reliable indicator of the disease than metabolic rates calculated for a unit of brain weight. Twenty patients with the probable diagnosis of AD and 17 similarly aged controls underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) studies as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within a few days of each other. Average metabolic rates, when corrected for atrophy, were 3.91 +/- 1.02 and 4.43 +/- 0.87 (mg of glucose per 100 cc brain tissue per min +/- s.d.) respectively for AD patients and controls. Two other indices were determined, atrophy weighted total brain metabolism (calculated by multiplying the brain volume, determined by MR analysis, by the average metabolic rate) and absolute whole brain metabolism (calculated by multiplying the brain volume by the average metabolic rate corrected for atrophy). The former showed a very significant difference between the two groups (29.96 +/- 7.90 for AD patients compared to 39.1 +/- 7.0 for controls, p < 0.001). Atrophy weighted total brain metabolism also correlated very well with mini mental status exam (MMSE) scores (r = 0.59, p < 0.01). Absolute whole brain metabolism was significantly different between AD and control groups and correlated well with MMSE. These data demonstrate that although the metabolic rate per unit weight of the brain is unchanged in AD compared to controls, atrophy weighted total brain metabolism and absolute whole brain metabolism are significantly affected. Both indices may prove to be a sensitive correlate for cognitive dysfunction in AD.",34,10,1681,1687,Internal medicine; Endocrinology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Carbohydrate metabolism; Positron emission tomography; Degenerative disease; Central nervous system disease; Atrophy; Nuclear medicine; Alzheimer's disease; Brain size; Medicine,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging/metabolism; Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging; Atrophy; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Deoxyglucose/analogs & derivatives; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Glucose/metabolism; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Tomography, Emission-Computed",Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Deoxyglucose; Glucose,NIMH NIH HHS (5-T32-MH-18902) United States; NIA NIH HHS (AG 03934-10) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (NICHD MRRC P30 HD26979) United States,http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/34/10/1681.full.pdf+html?frame=sidebar https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8410281/ https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/34/10/1681.short https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8410281 http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/34/10/1681.full.pdf https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/34/10/1681.full.pdf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8410281,8410281,,2336107543,,0,021-964-005-298-60X; 038-156-094-431-151; 082-414-298-443-706; 092-075-827-352-72X; 094-867-187-726-540,132,false,,

Aisen,"Objective: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter 52-week phase 2 trial of resveratrol in individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) examined its safety and tolerability and effects on biomarker (plasma Ab40 and Ab42, CSF Ab40, Ab42, tau, and phospho-tau 181) and volumetric MRI outcomes (primary outcomes) and clinical outcomes (secondary outcomes). Methods: Participants (n 5 119) were randomized to placebo or resveratrol 500 mg orally once daily (with dose escalation by 500-mg increments every 13 weeks, ending with 1,000 mg twice daily). Brain MRI and CSF collection were performed at baseline and after completion of treatment. Detailed pharmacokinetics were performed on a subset (n 5 15) at baseline and weeks 13, 26, 39, and 52. Results: Resveratrol and its major metabolites were measurable in plasma and CSF. The most common adverse events were nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss. CSF Ab40 and plasma Ab40 levels declined more in the placebo group than the resveratrol-treated group, resulting in a significant difference at week 52. Brain volume loss was increased by resveratrol treatment compared to placebo. Conclusions: Resveratrol was safe and well-tolerated. Resveratrol and its major metabolites penetrated the blood–brain barrier to have CNS effects. Further studies are required to interpret the biomarker changes associated with resveratrol treatment. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with AD resveratrol is safe, well-tolerated, and alters some AD biomarker trajectories. The study is rated Class II because more than 2 primary outcomes were designated.

Kramer; Jeffrey Kaye,"Importance While brain volume changes are used as surrogate markers for Alzheimer disease neuropathology in clinical studies, the extent to which these changes are due to pathologic features of Alzheimer disease in the aging brain is not well established. This study aims to clarify the neuropathologic correlates of longitudinal brain atrophy. Objective To examine the association between brain atrophy during life and neuropathology in an elderly population. Design Autopsy study of a cohort of elderly individuals. Setting Community-based population. Participants Seventy-one healthy elderly individuals were selected from participants of the Oregon Brain Aging Study for having an autopsy, more than 1 magnetic resonance imaging scan, and the last magnetic resonance imaging scan within 36 months of death. Main Outcomes and Measures The associations between brain volume trajectories (ventricular, total brain, and hippocampal) and time interaction terms for neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, gross infarcts, microinfarcts, amyloid angiopathy, Lewy bodies, APOE ϵ4 presence, and clinical diagnosis (no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia as time-varying covariates) were examined in mixed-effects models, adjusting for duration of follow-up and age at death. Results Ventricular volume trajectory was significantly associated with age, presence of infarcts, neurofibrillary tangle and neuritic plaque scores, APOE ϵ4 allele presence, and dementia diagnosis. Total brain volume trajectory was significantly associated with age and mild cognitive impairment diagnosis. Hippocampal volume trajectory was significantly associated with amyloid angiopathy. Conclusions and Relevance Ventricular volume trajectory is more sensitive than total brain and hippocampal volume trajectories as a marker of accruing Alzheimer disease and vascular pathology in elderly individuals. The association between brain volume trajectories and cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment and dementia) remained after controlling for the degree of neuropathology and other covariates. This suggests that there may be other factors not measured in this study that could be contributing to brain atrophy in those with cognitive impairment.",70,5,616,622,Pathology; Psychology; Cerebral amyloid angiopathy; Dementia; Aging brain; Cerebral atrophy; Neuropathology; Atrophy; Alzheimer's disease; Brain size,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging/pathology; Atrophy/pathology; Brain/blood supply; Cerebral Ventricles/pathology; Cognitive Dysfunction/pathology; Dementia/pathology; Female; Humans; Lewy Bodies/pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/instrumentation; Male; Neurofibrillary Tangles/pathology; Plaque, Amyloid/pathology",,NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG008017) United States; NIA NIH HHS (AG08017) United States,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3898525 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/articlepdf/1669205/noc120061_616_622.pdf https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/1669205 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898525/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23552688/ https://ohsu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/neuropathologic-basis-of-age-associated-brain-atrophy-2 https://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleID=1669205,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2013.1957,23552688,10.1001/jamaneurol.2013.1957,2077143809,PMC3898525,0,002-751-853-260-729; 005-472-277-640-607; 007-181-166-479-526; 007-342-776-080-453; 011-711-315-280-044; 014-151-882-396-437; 016-214-457-952-314; 018-491-754-959-991; 023-225-893-822-089; 026-082-968-487-494; 032-838-484-399-214; 033-131-077-610-112; 033-752-232-459-347; 033-767-915-419-151; 034-049-892-828-955; 034-655-772-919-385; 038-575-470-444-13X; 038-984-701-228-459; 043-134-967-618-120; 048-536-112-681-339; 048-883-529-839-601; 050-779-182-265-638; 051-544-883-553-528; 058-079-035-244-101; 064-685-627-244-276; 064-724-443-122-337; 064-742-684-363-202; 070-808-137-520-658; 086-028-249-085-180; 104-571-070-998-014; 116-594-026-587-178; 120-273-470-107-860; 126-333-545-830-894; 136-419-053-496-340; 141-850-572-581-335; 153-009-410-577-849; 163-614-125-673-899; 191-357-128-261-911,99,true,,green

Schott,"Classification of dementia based on measures of brain volume has been studied previously. However, many of these studies use clinical diagnosis as the gold standard and/or investigate group separation of particular dementias from healthy controls. In this study, we investigate the more clinically important problem of differential diagnosis of cases with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) or other pathology. Using retrospective data from patients who attended clinics in three different European centres (VUMC-Amsterdam, DRC-London, IAH-Newcastle) we evaluated the diagnostic utility of applying automated segmentation and machine learning to this clinically realistic dataset. Multi-label segmentation propagation, based on 83 manually segmented regions from 30 subjects, was applied to T1-weighted volumetric MRI scans from 305 patients with pathologically-confirmed dementia (127 AD, 49 DLB, 80 FTLD, 49 other). Segmented volumes were corrected for age, gender, total intracranial volume and scanner, then scaled to zero mean and unit variance over subjects. The dataset was then divided into training (n=153) and testing sets (n=152), preserving pathology proportions. Univariate feature selection was applied such that only the top 10% of regions most important for prediction were used in the models. Group separation was quantified using a linear support vector machine with cross-validation. Class weighting was applied to adjust for unbalanced groups. Three classifiers were trained to separate each of the three main dementia groups from the pooled group of all other dementias. A further three classifiers were trained to discriminate each pair of the main dementia groups. Feature selection demonstrated higher accuracies for group separation than using all features. Central structures including the putamen, thalamus and substantia nigra, and temporal lobe regions helped to distinguish FTLD from DLB. AD and FTLD were best distinguished using frontal/occipital lobe regions, and AD and DLB using temporal/parietal regions (Table1). Classification accuracy was greatest for AD pathology in all models (Figure1). Classification of dementia pathology based on brain substructure volumes may help to maximise the diagnostic information available from clinical T1-weighted MRI. Performing feature selection using these volumes in autopsy-confirmed subjects could identify brain regions with diagnostic specificity for particular pathologies. A) 3 separate SVMs trained to classify each of the 3 main dementia groups from the pooled group of other dementias. B) A further 3 classifiers trained to discriminate each pair of the main dementia groups. Performance of each SVM is summarised by the area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic with 95% confidence intervals in brackets.",10,4S_Part_14,,,Frontotemporal lobar degeneration; Dementia; Medicine; Frontotemporal dementia; Dementia with Lewy bodies; Pathology; Pattern recognition (psychology); Artificial intelligence; Disease; Computer science,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2014.05.866,,10.1016/j.jalz.2014.05.866,,,0,,0,false,,

The aim of this study was to longitudinally evaluate an index based on morphometric measures derived from MRI data that could be used for classification of AD and healthy control subjects, as well as prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Patients originated from the AddNeuroMed project at baseline (119 AD, 119 MCI, 110 controls (CTL)) and 1-year follow-up (62 AD, 73 MCI, 79 CTL). Data consisted of 3D T1-weighted MR images, demographics, MMSE, ADAS-Cog, CERAD and CDR scores, and APOE e4 status. We computed an index using a multivariate classification model (AD vs. CTL), using orthogonal partial least squares to latent structures (OPLS). Sensitivity, specificity and AUC were determined. Performance of the classifier (AD vs. CTL) was high at baseline (10-fold cross-validation, 84% sensitivity, 91% specificity, 0.93 AUC) and at 1-year follow-up (92% sensitivity, 74% specificity, 0.93 AUC). Predictions of conversion from MCI to AD were good at baseline (77% of MCI converters) and at follow-up (91% of MCI converters). MCI carriers of the APOE e4 allele manifested more atrophy and presented a faster cognitive decline when compared to non-carriers. The derived index demonstrated a steady increase in atrophy over time, yielding higher accuracy in prediction at the time of clinical conversion. Neuropsychological tests appeared less sensitive to changes over time. However, taking the average of the two time points yielded better correlation between the index and cognitive scores as opposed to using cross-sectional data only. Thus, multivariate classification seemed to detect patterns of AD changes before conversion from MCI to AD and including longitudinal information is of great importance.",6,,145,145,Correlation; Internal medicine; Cross-sectional study; Neuropsychology; Oncology; Psychology; Atrophy; Cognitive decline; OPLS; Alzheimer's disease; Cohort; Gerontology,APOE4; Alzheimer disease; MCI; MRI; OPLS; multivariate statistics,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/29939578 https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/622549 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4094911 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnagi.2014.00145/abstract https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2014.00145/full http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4094911 https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/publications/622549 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2014.00145/pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25071554/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2014.00145,25071554,10.3389/fnagi.2014.00145,2046189693,PMC4094911,0,001-363-163-587-838; 001-471-286-409-431; 001-595-533-823-694; 002-373-471-231-88X; 002-796-015-264-48X; 003-248-637-497-498; 004-615-343-305-292; 005-003-498-720-764; 005-884-147-863-790; 007-446-871-421-830; 007-617-635-606-642; 007-926-350-022-247; 008-803-775-862-571; 008-989-867-184-42X; 009-087-121-934-320; 010-155-244-775-240; 010-830-961-809-040; 011-186-537-757-968; 011-386-154-387-740; 013-233-282-641-69X; 013-412-120-139-860; 013-874-665-128-711; 014-118-390-880-949; 016-781-011-490-187; 017-757-809-268-557; 018-622-691-667-330; 018-981-464-684-143; 021-254-065-724-459; 022-988-712-445-94X; 023-840-836-655-119; 025-675-600-604-661; 025-921-219-887-720; 026-169-505-156-578; 026-607-325-932-055; 026-698-558-908-351; 026-744-790-713-553; 027-133-905-697-957; 027-931-352-001-10X; 028-150-389-773-597; 028-454-417-537-093; 029-701-419-896-067; 030-817-860-393-460; 031-818-054-450-257; 033-283-940-337-042; 033-620-120-989-576; 034-804-518-224-103; 042-508-095-450-275; 044-837-344-106-978; 046-393-930-104-420; 046-468-701-504-766; 048-536-112-681-339; 052-013-750-492-585; 052-690-172-487-095; 052-725-632-515-382; 055-779-066-831-198; 056-040-486-905-932; 056-265-041-570-022; 056-369-140-669-630; 058-030-738-206-040; 059-964-163-231-020; 062-150-909-624-812; 065-150-371-353-510; 066-375-702-069-949; 069-245-013-350-093; 072-746-509-542-025; 072-951-479-677-668; 077-152-915-735-344; 077-446-220-030-448; 081-325-542-805-801; 081-770-307-806-295; 084-194-881-700-504; 088-937-296-770-923; 089-014-295-999-217; 090-917-665-223-022; 096-061-142-352-741; 106-538-221-745-005; 107-148-727-785-840; 114-691-154-742-189; 115-887-728-358-540; 116-726-708-427-050; 139-400-855-375-355; 141-139-127-112-456; 157-053-690-463-056; 169-719-725-592-477,33,true,cc-by,gold

Callahan; Olivier Potvin; Stephan Saikali; Simon Duchesne,"Background The standard method of ascertaining Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains postmortem assessment of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary degeneration. Vascular pathology, Lewy bodies, TDP-43, and hippocampal sclerosis are frequent comorbidities. There is therefore a need for biomarkers that can assess these etiologies and provide a diagnosis in vivo. Objective We conducted a systematic review of published radiological-pathological correlation studies to determine the relationship between antemortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropathological findings in AD. Methods We explored PubMed in June-July 2015 using ""Alzheimer's disease"" and combinations of radiological and pathological terms. After exclusion following screening and full-text assessment of the 552 extracted manuscripts, three others were added from their reference list. In the end, we report results based on 27 articles. Results Independently of normal age-related brain atrophy, AD pathology is associated with whole-brain and hippocampal atrophy and ventricular expansion as observed on T1-weighted images. Moreover, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cortical microinfarcts are also related to brain volume loss in AD. Hippocampal sclerosis and TDP-43 are associated with hippocampal and medial temporal lobe atrophy, respectively. Brain volume loss correlates more strongly with tangles than with any other pathological finding. White matter hyperintensities observed on proton density, T2-weighted and FLAIR images are strongly related to vascular pathologies, but are also associated with other histological changes such as gliosis or demyelination. Conclusion Cerebral atrophy and white matter changes in the living brain reflect underlying neuropathology and may be detectable using antemortem MRI. In vivo MRI may therefore be an avenue for AD pathological staging.",57,2,575,601,Pathology; Hyperintensity; Hippocampal sclerosis; Cerebral amyloid angiopathy; Cerebral atrophy; Neuropathology; Atrophy; Pathological staging; Alzheimer's disease; Medicine,Alzheimer’s disease; antemortem diagnosis; dementia; magnetic resonance imaging; neuroimaging; neuropathology,Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28282807/ https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28282807 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28282807 https://www.medra.org/servlet/aliasResolver?alias=iospress&doi=10.3233/JAD-161028 https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad161028,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/jad-161028,28282807,10.3233/jad-161028,2593173144,,0,001-168-112-394-936; 001-595-533-823-694; 002-193-762-129-852; 005-420-997-217-538; 005-902-805-939-053; 007-563-160-471-359; 008-664-152-041-825; 008-996-786-878-61X; 010-830-689-824-806; 011-345-772-064-024; 013-495-180-143-286; 014-151-882-396-437; 017-970-546-672-488; 018-168-175-843-572; 018-565-702-242-058; 020-521-348-012-635; 020-798-450-711-581; 021-191-928-332-130; 022-631-258-259-239; 023-841-084-079-802; 023-868-705-394-793; 024-001-733-906-746; 024-569-791-613-257; 025-633-403-647-51X; 026-932-630-642-432; 029-114-287-607-860; 032-838-484-399-214; 034-028-686-300-129; 034-215-249-466-159; 035-740-987-536-19X; 036-314-308-933-279; 038-984-701-228-459; 040-075-341-228-431; 040-245-531-863-726; 040-622-466-008-029; 041-159-816-865-579; 041-795-318-802-310; 042-930-611-537-179; 043-134-967-618-120; 043-886-420-647-333; 044-849-820-396-901; 046-318-564-940-890; 051-897-317-303-376; 053-914-758-245-831; 057-613-908-237-404; 058-447-936-385-864; 059-552-734-117-715; 062-595-226-438-270; 063-197-855-380-131; 064-724-443-122-337; 065-271-508-087-542; 066-386-470-196-407; 070-381-923-334-203; 070-692-386-299-788; 073-131-356-727-242; 077-113-444-615-212; 083-275-795-865-394; 085-637-125-487-353; 088-131-153-059-541; 090-917-665-223-022; 092-649-198-290-481; 093-137-819-019-588; 093-314-713-624-768; 094-316-146-557-698; 100-388-306-690-841; 106-427-093-424-01X; 109-549-459-933-893; 110-780-209-136-856; 111-222-857-055-43X; 113-567-567-262-939; 114-552-684-947-237; 114-930-306-723-813; 130-690-342-982-329; 131-921-576-299-401; 141-850-572-581-335; 162-474-342-330-480; 173-220-616-388-444; 184-321-862-684-072,56,false,,

This disease causes cell death and nerve tissue damage in the brain. The brain damage can be detected using brain volume, whole brain form, and genetic testing. In this research, we propose texture analysis of the brain and genomic analysis to detect Alzheimer’s disease. 3D MRI images were chosen to analyze the texture of the brain, and microarray data were chosen to analyze gene expression. We classified Alzheimer’s disease into three types: Alzheimer’s, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Normal. In this study, texture analysis was carried out by using the Advanced Local Binary Pattern (ALBP) and the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). We also propose the bi-clustering method to analyze microarray data. The experimental results from texture analysis show that ALBP had better performance than GLCM in classification of Alzheimer’s disease. The ALBP method achieved an average value of accuracy of between 75% - 100% for binary classification of the whole brain data. Furthermore, Biclustering method with microarray data shows good performance gene expression, where this information show influence Alzheimer’s disease with total of bi-cluster is 6.</jats:p>",8,2,111,120,Gene expression; Artificial intelligence; Pattern recognition; Texture (geology); Bi clustering; Mri brain; Computer science; Feature extraction; Local binary patterns,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1515/jaiscr-2018-0008 https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/jaiscr/8/2/article-p111.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jaiscr/jaiscr8.html#BustamamSA18 https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/jaiscr/8/2/article-p111.xml http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-528bcdc4-d39b-4556-af95-5f532c0c37ac/c/bustamam_texture_and_gene.pdf http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-528bcdc4-d39b-4556-af95-5f532c0c37ac https://sciendo.com/article/10.1515/jaiscr-2018-0008 https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/jaiscr-2018-0008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jaiscr-2018-0008,,10.1515/jaiscr-2018-0008,2765400582,,0,003-213-459-058-440; 006-904-828-430-44X; 010-906-426-154-829; 012-140-970-151-257; 012-331-275-261-253; 012-560-424-199-879; 023-014-725-113-97X; 033-481-700-352-486; 034-073-120-160-844; 035-837-569-906-742; 040-704-574-813-331; 041-765-737-001-852; 054-060-415-607-853; 057-310-944-519-312; 062-024-604-657-149; 068-787-657-265-310; 069-796-004-115-930; 082-752-157-955-89X; 084-294-524-921-147; 089-370-645-222-119; 107-466-032-508-090; 120-678-705-948-556; 123-137-942-742-700; 126-073-266-308-106; 128-636-066-833-271; 136-927-436-582-247; 180-119-728-097-526; 193-335-350-130-096,13,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

Mathalon; Adolf Pfefferbaum; Kelvin O. Lim; Margaret J. Rosenbloom; Edith V. Sullivan,"Background Schizophrenia and alcoholism are characterized by brain volume abnormalities. Despite the frequent comorbidity of these conditions, the potentially compounded effects of comorbidity on brain structure have seldom been rigorously assessed. Methods To determine the compounding effect of schizophrenia and alcoholism on regional brain volumes, we performed retrospective quantitative analysis of magnetic resonance images from men who participated in research protocols at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, Calif. Participants were selected on the basis of diagnostic criteria, yielding 4 comparison groups: 35 men comorbid for DSM-III-R schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and lifetime alcohol abuse or dependence; 64 men with DSM-III-R schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; 62 men with Research Diagnostic Criteria alcoholism; and 62 healthy men screened to exclude any Axis I diagnosis or heavy alcohol use. The comorbid group matched the schizophrenia group on age and illness severity but was younger and drank 5 times less alcohol in their lifetimes than the alcoholism group. Gray and white matter volumes from 6 cortical regions were expressed as age- and head size–corrected z scores and were subjected to multivariate profile analyses. Results Gray matter volume deficits were present in all 3 patient groups but were greatest in the comorbid group. In the comorbid group, the most prominent volume deficits were in the prefrontal and anterior superior temporal regions. Conclusions Despite lower alcohol exposure than in pure alcoholism, the comorbidity of schizophrenia with alcoholism has a particularly profound effect on prefrontal gray matter volume, compounding the prominent prefrontal deficits present independently in schizophrenia and alcoholism.",60,3,245,252,Psychiatry; Psychology; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; Research Diagnostic Criteria; Comorbidity; Alcohol dependence; Psychosis; Schizoaffective disorder; Alcohol abuse; Brain size; Clinical psychology,,"Adult; Alcohol Drinking/epidemiology; Alcoholism/diagnosis; Brain/anatomy & histology; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale/statistics & numerical data; Comorbidity; Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry)/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/statistics & numerical data; Male; Prefrontal Cortex/anatomy & histology; Schizophrenia/diagnosis; Substance-Related Disorders/diagnosis; Temporal Lobe/anatomy & histology",,NIAAA NIH HHS (AA05965) United States; NIAAA NIH HHS (AA10723) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (MH30854) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (MH58007) United States,https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/compounded-brain-volume-deficits-in-schizophrenia-alcoholism-como https://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=207265 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207265,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archpsyc.60.3.245,12622657,10.1001/archpsyc.60.3.245,2115653822,,0,001-323-029-679-006; 002-992-402-340-41X; 003-205-444-560-745; 005-907-103-181-957; 013-007-399-818-369; 013-544-896-025-830; 014-149-717-630-493; 017-090-449-066-819; 017-614-725-237-35X; 017-691-522-313-980; 019-094-256-442-479; 019-196-339-016-982; 019-648-478-708-537; 020-960-222-028-070; 022-238-121-146-021; 022-569-286-990-040; 022-988-712-445-94X; 025-494-098-797-329; 027-345-457-709-778; 027-453-006-441-15X; 027-784-038-153-60X; 027-789-784-308-258; 027-857-529-295-148; 027-963-479-689-702; 030-057-673-328-947; 030-242-025-155-886; 030-773-828-225-094; 035-606-930-550-612; 037-315-527-142-101; 037-834-151-019-31X; 038-623-323-979-226; 042-974-970-239-004; 044-634-044-082-572; 045-933-195-284-821; 050-344-426-327-629; 053-909-977-766-278; 056-224-230-195-46X; 056-243-123-371-986; 056-331-681-579-343; 056-929-645-750-680; 060-967-737-190-010; 063-314-964-834-008; 063-676-301-863-324; 066-955-924-950-038; 069-468-432-599-342; 069-943-192-166-790; 070-690-752-358-874; 071-883-527-186-583; 075-342-197-536-512; 075-825-259-287-176; 076-066-449-816-843; 078-571-724-461-857; 080-397-153-313-631; 083-965-691-789-866; 084-597-483-266-235; 085-799-569-599-366; 088-284-132-267-533; 096-699-450-525-897; 100-599-603-715-283; 104-957-837-444-079; 105-803-012-063-153; 106-108-022-527-216; 107-429-956-925-641; 108-211-338-009-456; 112-507-152-703-172; 123-127-983-744-025; 135-311-035-226-530; 135-984-344-374-699; 136-399-503-505-65X; 138-864-654-742-242; 150-176-107-480-12X; 152-743-326-072-434; 160-801-167-169-660,100,true,,bronze
020-382-159-226-16X,A Reduced Gray Matter Volume in Patients with Bipolar II Disorder in a Japanese Sample: A Comparison with Schizophrenia,,2016,journal article,Bipolar Disorder: Open Access,24721077,OMICS Publishing Group,,Akeo Kurumaji; Michio Itasaka; Akihito Uezato; Kazuo Takiguchi; Daisuke Jitoku; Mizue Hobo; Kiyotaka Nemoto,"Objective: Neuroimaging studies of bipolar disorders have provided an insight into the pathophysiology, and have raised an issue of a shared change with schizophrenia and the normalizing effect of lithium on the alteration. Despite the classification of the bipolar disorders into the bipolar I disorder (BP-I) and bipolar II disorder (BP-II), the patients with BP-II have only been involved in a limited number of the neuroimaging studies. There is minimal information about the direct comparison between BP-II and schizophrenia.; Methods: All patients were diagnosed using DSM-5 criteria. A cross-sectional study was carried out to compare the regional brain volumes among the patients with BP-II taking lithium (BP-II-On, n=17) and not taking it (BP-II-Off, n=22), the patients with schizophrenia (n=35) and healthy controls (n=36). The MRI data were processed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 and the divided brain areas were defined by an automated anatomical labeling.; Results: A significant reduction in the gray matter volume of the frontal, temporal and limbic lobes was similarly observed in BP-II-off and schizophrenia patients when compared to the controls. The brain volume of BP-II-On had significantly decreased in the temporal lobe, but not in either the frontal or limbic lobe. The less pronounced reduction of BP-II-On was also observed in the sub-regions of the prefrontal and limbic cortices, such as the anterior cingulate cortex.; Conclusion: The present study suggests that there was a similarity in the distribution pattern of the decreased gray matter volume in the brain between BP-II and schizophrenia, placing an emphasis on the lithium effect that putatively normalized the abnormality in the anterior frontal and limbic brain areas of BP-II. However, further studies are required to replicate the results in a larger cohort and to confirm the lithium effect in a longitudinal study.",2,2,1,6,Psychology; Neuroscience; Bipolar II disorder; Anterior cingulate cortex; Bipolar I disorder; Temporal lobe; Prefrontal cortex; Statistical parametric mapping; Audiology; Brain size; Schizophrenia,,,,,https://www.longdom.org/abstract/a-reduced-gray-matter-volume-in-patients-with-bipolar-ii-disorder-in-a-japanese-sample-a-comparison-with-schizophrenia-15386.html https://www.omicsonline.org/peer-reviewed/a-reduced-gray-matter-volume-in-patients-with-bipolar-ii-disorder-in-arnjapanese-sample-a-comparison-with-schizophrenia-84156.html https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/a-reduced-gray-matter-volume-in-patients-with-bipolar-ii-disorder-in-ajapanese-sample-a-comparison-with-schizophrenia-2472-1077-1000110.php?aid=84156 https://www.longdom.org/open-access/a-reduced-gray-matter-volume-in-patients-with-bipolar-ii-disorder-in-ajapanese-sample-a-comparison-with-schizophrenia-2472-1077-1000110.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2472-1077.1000110,,10.4172/2472-1077.1000110,2569979725,,0,,0,false,,

Liver disease was identified using ICD-9 classification codes. Brain volume and cognition were assessed serially using 3T-MRI and a cognitive battery. 1008, 2157, and 780 participants were included in the MRI, cognitive, and plasma biomarker analysis, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, liver disease was associated with accelerated decline in total brain and white matter volume, but not total gray matter or AD signature region volume. Although liver disease showed no relationship with domain-specific cognitive decline or plasma biomarkers, participants with a history of hepatitis demonstrated accelerated decline in verbal fluency and elevated neurofilament light.

Methods: In this longitudinal analysis, we use a data-driven approach clustering PD patients from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) (n = 314, age = 61.0 ± 9.5, 34.1% female, 5 years follow-up). Voxel-level neuroanatomical features were estimated using deformation-based morphometry (DBM) of T1-weighted MRI. Voxels whose deformation values were significantly correlated (P Results: Two neuroanatomical biotypes were identified: (i) biotype 1 (n = 114) with subcortical brain volumes smaller than heathy controls; (ii) biotype 2 (n = 200) with subcortical brain volumes larger than heathy controls. Biotype 1 had more severe motor impairment, autonomic dysfunction, and very much worse REM sleep behavior disorder than biotype 2 at baseline. Although disease duration at initial visit and follow-up were similar between biotypes, PD patients with smaller subcortical brain volume had poorer prognosis, with more rapid decline in several clinical domains and in dopamine functional neuroimaging over an average of five years. Conclusion: Robust neuroanatomical biotypes exist in PD with distinct clinical and neuroanatomical pattern. These biotypes can be detected at diagnosis, and predict the course of longitudinal progression, which should benefit trial design and evaluation.

O'Leary; Amy Librant; Nancy C. Andreasen; Thomas H. Wassink,"Context—Relatively little is known about genetic determinants of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Recent studies suggest that a BDNF prodomain SNP, resulting in valine to methionine substitution, is associated with impaired declarative memory in healthy volunteers and in schizophrenia patients. These studies indicate that BDNFMet variant may mediate hippocampal cognitive functions by modulating intracellular trafficking and activity-dependent BDNF release. How this functional SNP affects other neurocognitive measures have not been examined. Its role in determining cognitive deficits in schizophrenia has not been systematically studied either. Objective—To characterize the neurocognitive and brain morphometric phenotypic correlates of BDNF val66met polymorphism, and test the specificity of BDNFMet variant on cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Design, Setting and Participants—A comprehensive battery of standardized neuropsychological tests was administered to 144 healthy volunteers and 293 schizophreniaspectrum disorder patients at a tertiary-care university hospital. Approximately two-thirds of the sample also underwent high-resolution MRI brain scans. Main Outcome Measures—Genotype effects (Met-allele-carriers versus Val homozygotes) on five cognitive domain z-scores and MRI gray matter (GM) brain volume measures (Talairach-atlas based cerebral lobes and optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM)) were examined using general linear models. Results—On verbal memory, there was a significant genotype effect but no genotype-bydiagnosis effects. In both patients and healthy volunteers, Met-allele-carriers had poorer verbal memory performance than their Val/Val counterparts. On visuospatial abilities, there were significant genotype and genotype-by-diagnosis effects. Met allele-associated visuospatial impairment was specific to patients, but not healthy volunteers.

Fifty participants (11 cognitively unimpaired [CU], 10 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 29 with AD) who underwent 18F-florbetaben positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and neuropsychological tests were enrolled. The hippocampal subfield volumes were obtained using an automated brain volumetry system with the Winterburn atlas and were compared among the diagnostic groups, and the correlations with the Aβ deposition and AD risk factors were determined. Patients with MCI and AD showed decreased volume in the stratum radiatum/lacunosum/moleculare (SRLM) of the cornu ammonis (CA)1 and CA4-dentate gyrus (DG) compared with the CU. Decreased SRLM and CA4-DG volumes were associated with an increased Aβ deposition in the global cortex (R = −0.459, p = 0.001; R = −0.393, p = 0.005, respectively). The SRLM and CA4-DG volumes aided in the distinction of AD from CU (areas under the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC] curve = 0.994 and 0.981, respectively, p < 0.001), and Aβ+ from Aβ− individuals (AUROC curve = 0.949 and 0.958, respectively, p < 0.001).

Schott,"The neurodegenerative disorders all share a broad common mechanism: accumulation of abnormal protein within the nervous system leads to excess neuronal loss. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the prototypic neurodegenerative disease, is associated with accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of phosphorylated tau which preceded excess neuronal loss within specific brain regions, notably the medial temporal lobes. Other neurodegenerative disorders (including frontotemporal dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies) are associated with deposition of different proteins, and different patterns of regional brain loss. Cross-sectional neuroimaging is widely used for diagnostic purposes and research, with MRI (and more recently PET) being used as inclusion/exclusion criteria and safety outcome measure for clinical trials. Serial MRI is widely used to assess the extent and pattern of progression in neurodegenerative diseases both for observational and therapeutic studies. In observational studies, longitudinal MRI-based measures of brain volume change (reflecting cerebral atrophy) are used to provide insights into the timing, extent and correlates of neurodegeneration. For clinical trials serial MRI based measures of atrophy are widely used as outcome measures, both to distinguish symptomatic from disease-modifying drug effects — under the premise that the latter but not the former will lead to attenuation of atrophy rate in the treated group compared to placebo — and to reduce sample size requirement. If atrophy based measures are to be used as outcome measures, it is essential that image acquisition is carefully planned and undertaken to provide appropriate tissue classification and stability over time. Thereafter, it is over to the image analyst. In this talk I will discuss the enduser requirements of an image-analysis tool, focusing on the need for clinicians and image analysts to work closely together to ensure that any such techniques produce not only robust but also clinically relevant results. In the absence of a gold standard means of assessing the validity of any methods of determining brain volume change over time, safeguards to help provide reassurance will be discussed, including the use of simulated atrophy; comparison with manual techniques; and ensuring techniques are commutative/symmetric and transitive, reproducible and biological plausible. The importance of striving to reduce variance — the key factor influencing sample size — will be emphasized, with the caveat that the most that can be asked of any image analytical tool is to reduce within subject variability. The advantages and pitfalls of using sample size reduction per se as a criterion for comparing techniques will also be covered, with particular regard to data produced from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative.",,,912,912,Pathology; Neuroscience; Observational study; Neurodegeneration; Dementia with Lewy bodies; Frontotemporal dementia; Cerebral atrophy; Atrophy; Neuroimaging; Brain size; Medicine,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6235700/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/isbi/isbi2012.html#Schott12 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6235700/ http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/isbi/isbi2012.html#Schott12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/isbi.2012.6235700,,10.1109/isbi.2012.6235700,2065286932,,0,,0,false,,

Objective This study investigated whether taking the antihypertensive drug losartan, in addition to normal care, would slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease when compared with a placebo. Design A double-blind multicentre randomised controlled trial, after a 4-week open-label phase, with follow-up at 14 days and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The primary outcome was based on measured imaging differences in brain volume between baseline and 12 months. Setting Twenty-three NHS hospital trusts across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Participants Patients diagnosed with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease were eligible to participate if they met the following criteria: (1) aged ≥ 55 years; (2) a Mini Mental State Examination score of 15–28; (3) a modified Hachinski Ischaemic Score of ≤ 5; (4) a previous computerised tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease; (5) a study companion who was willing to participate in the study; and (6) capacity to consent for themselves. Patients were ineligible if they were (1) taking or intolerant to renin–angiotensin system-related medications, (2) unlikely to undergo magnetic resonance imaging or (3) unlikely to complete the trial protocol. People who had blood pressure outside the normal ranges, defined cardiovascular issues, impaired liver or renal function, or a primary neurodegenerative disease that was not Alzheimer’s disease were also excluded, as were women who had not reached menopause and were unwilling to take relevant protocol-specific safety precautions. Intervention The intervention was either 100 mg of overencapsulated losartan (Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, Petah Tikva, Israel) daily or a matched placebo for 12 months. Main outcome measures Difference in brain atrophy, represented by measurement of whole-brain volume before and following 12 months of treatment post randomisation, was measured using volumetric MRI and determined by boundary shift interval analysis. Secondary outcomes included changes in rates of Alzheimer’s disease progression (as assessed using the ADAS-Cog, Mini Mental State Examination and Neuropsychiatric Inventory), the volume of white matter hyperintensities, cerebral blood flow (assessed by magnetic resonance imaging), blood pressure, magnetic resonance imaging measures of atrophy and association with measures of cognitive decline, and drug compliance and tolerability. Results A total of 261 participants entered the open-label phase, of whom 211 were randomised to the intervention (n = 105) or placebo (n = 106) arms. Of the 197 people (93%) who completed the study, 81% (n = 171) had a valid primary outcome. The difference in brain volume between arms was consistent with chance (–2.79 ml, 95% confidence interval –6.46 to 0.89 ml; p = 0.19), and there was no evidence of benefit for any of the secondary outcome measures. Limitations Our study had 82% power to detect treatment-based changes and, as a result, may have been underpowered or, more likely, the intervention, which may not have crossed the blood–brain barrier as much as expected, may have been given too late or for an insufficient amount of time in the disease process to influence the outcomes. Conclusions Losartan administered over 12 months did not alter brain atrophy in Alzheimer’s disease. Future work Other related ‘sartans’ could be tested in patient groups with mild cognitive impairment and for longer to fully test this hypothesis.

Senthil Kumaran; Madhuri Behari; Ramesh Kumar Agrawal,"Introduction; Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder, which is diagnosed on the basis of clinical history and examination alone as there are no diagnostic tests available. However, the current diagnosis highly depends on the knowledge and experience of clinicians and hence subjective in nature. Thus, the focus of this study is to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) method using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate PD from controls.; ; Method:; The proposed method utilizes graph-theory-based spectral feature selection method to select a set of discriminating features from whole brain volume. A decision model is built using support vector machine as a classifier with leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. The performance measures, namely, sensitivity, specificity, and classification accuracy, are utilized to evaluate the performance of the decision model. The efficacy of the proposed method is checked on volumetric 3D T1-weighted (1 mm iso-voxel) MRI dataset of 30 PD patients and 30 age and gender matched controls acquired with 1.5T MRI scanner.; ; Results:; Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to differentiate PD from controls with an accuracy of 86.67%, which encourages the use of CAD. The performance of the proposed method outperforms the existing methods except one. In addition, it is observed that the maximum number of selected features belong to caudate region followed by cuneus region. Thus, these regions may be considered as potential biomarkers in diagnosis of PD.; ; Conclusion; The proposed method may be utilized by the clinicians for diagnosis of PD. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper deals with the problem of exploiting both data, in a combined way, to develop a tool able to support clinicians in the study and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). In this work, 69 subjects from the ADNI open database, 33 AD patients and 36 healthy controls, were analyzed. The possible existence of a relationship between brain structure modifications and altered functions between patients and healthy controls was investigated performing a correlation analysis on brain volume, calculated from the MRI image, the clustering coefficient, derived from fRMI acquisitions, and the Mini Mental Score Examination (MMSE). A statistically-significant correlation was found only in four ROIs after Bonferroni’s correction. The correlation analysis alone was still not sufficient to provide a reliable and powerful clinical tool in AD diagnosis however. Therefore, a machine learning strategy was studied by training a set of support vector machine classifiers comparing different features. The use of a unimodal approach led to unsatisfactory results, whereas the multimodal approach, i.e., the synergistic combination of MRI, fMRI, and MMSE features, resulted in an accuracy of 95.65%, a specificity of 97.22%, and a sensibility of 93.93%.",9,15,3156,,Correlation; Support vector machine; Bonferroni correction; Magnetic resonance imaging; Set (psychology); Cognition; Multimodal therapy; Brain size; Medicine; Physical medicine and rehabilitation,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/15/3156 https://iris.unica.it/handle/11584/276930 https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/15/3156/pdf https://iris.unica.it/bitstream/11584/276930/1/applsci-09-03156-v2.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/228004136.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app9153156,,10.3390/app9153156,2966309635,,0,000-074-468-437-251; 000-244-909-623-738; 001-471-286-409-431; 001-820-189-013-788; 003-275-511-441-628; 004-209-877-128-960; 006-951-807-320-761; 008-897-393-364-809; 009-087-121-934-320; 010-903-727-288-747; 012-998-325-766-248; 013-874-665-128-711; 015-528-024-144-536; 015-902-614-151-864; 017-738-236-870-212; 018-036-225-867-683; 018-816-880-695-168; 018-892-024-046-020; 020-361-593-258-639; 022-496-565-102-224; 022-839-928-899-423; 022-988-712-445-94X; 023-014-725-113-97X; 025-177-078-852-037; 026-947-303-604-043; 028-553-464-474-201; 030-110-072-735-977; 031-180-372-583-485; 031-284-939-140-527; 032-925-903-485-615; 033-767-915-419-151; 036-803-586-292-27X; 036-915-587-697-152; 038-633-979-099-474; 038-886-963-014-590; 039-935-252-680-428; 040-330-943-075-175; 045-649-228-286-762; 050-630-113-930-061; 050-660-832-584-051; 054-547-703-039-461; 057-283-214-977-935; 061-011-126-260-497; 062-061-819-555-708; 064-372-540-475-533; 067-915-297-350-489; 068-684-306-653-782; 069-132-144-884-852; 069-570-589-924-52X; 073-437-111-659-415; 073-955-089-379-758; 074-006-733-400-469; 074-227-623-719-371; 076-534-491-581-122; 078-064-252-404-224; 078-399-660-434-603; 079-204-460-064-373; 080-111-178-746-736; 080-202-268-807-006; 086-028-249-085-180; 086-553-125-974-694; 088-595-714-868-804; 094-969-743-661-686; 097-313-675-989-336; 100-495-338-876-601; 102-950-831-653-385; 113-973-431-964-847; 113-981-482-178-328; 115-030-320-240-44X; 118-594-529-167-768; 126-746-855-568-989; 131-686-817-707-49X; 132-046-768-367-337; 133-947-758-366-415; 146-031-851-686-415; 152-743-326-072-434; 169-993-823-699-421,19,true,cc-by,gold

Bendlin,"Importance Identifying risk factors for brain atrophy during the aging process can help direct new preventive approaches for dementia and cognitive decline. The association of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage with brain volume in this context is not well known. Objective To test whether neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with decreased brain volume in a cognitively unimpaired population enriched for Alzheimer disease risk. Design, Setting, and Participants This study, conducted from January 6, 2010, to January 17, 2019, at an academic research neuroimaging center, used cross-sectional data on 951 participants from 2 large, ongoing cohort studies of Alzheimer disease (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention and Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center clinical cohort). Participants were cognitively unimpaired based on National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer’s Association workgroup diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease, confirmed through a consensus diagnosis panel. The cohort was enriched for Alzheimer disease risk based on family history of dementia. Statistical analysis was performed from April 3 to September 27, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures The Area Deprivation Index, a geospatially determined index of neighborhood-level disadvantage, and cardiovascular disease risk indices were calculated for each participant. Linear regression models were fitted to test associations between relative neighborhood-level disadvantage (highest 20% based on state of residence) and hippocampal and total brain tissue volume, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Results In the primary analysis of 951 participants (637 women [67.0%]; mean [SD] age, 63.9 [8.1] years), living in the 20% most disadvantaged neighborhoods was associated with 4.1% lower hippocampal volume (β = −317.44; 95% CI, −543.32 to −91.56;P = .006) and 2.0% lower total brain tissue volume (β = −20 959.67; 95% CI, −37 611.92 to −4307.43;P = .01), after controlling for intracranial volume, individual-level educational attainment, age, and sex. Robust propensity score–matched analyses determined that this association was not due to racial/ethnic or demographic characteristics. Cardiovascular risk score, examined in a subsample of 893 participants, mediated this association for total brain tissue but not for hippocampal volume. Conclusions and Relevance For cognitively unimpaired individuals, living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods was associated with significantly lower cerebral volumes, after controlling for maximal premorbid (total intracranial) volume. This finding suggests an association of community socioeconomic context, distinct from individual-level socioeconomic status, with brain volume during aging. Cardiovascular risk mediated this association for total brain tissue volume but not for hippocampal volume, suggesting that neighborhood-level disadvantage may be associated with these 2 outcomes via distinct biological pathways.",77,4,451,460,Framingham Risk Score; Cohort study; Dementia; Population; Cognitive decline; Alzheimer's disease; Brain size; Medicine; Cohort; Gerontology,,Aged; Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging; Cerebral Cortex/diagnostic imaging; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hippocampus/diagnostic imaging; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Organ Size/physiology; Poverty; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors,,NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG021155) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG037639) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG033514) United States; NIGMS NIH HHS (T32 GM008692) United States; NIMHD NIH HHS (R01 MD010243) United States; NIA NIH HHS (F31 AG062116) United States; NIA NIH HHS (RF1 AG027161) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R56 AG037639) United States; NIA NIH HHS (RF1 AG057784) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG054059) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG062715) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG027161) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31904767 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31904767/ https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2757868 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/articlepdf/2757868/jamaneurology_hunt_2020_oi_190106.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31904767 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6990953,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2019.4501,31904767,10.1001/jamaneurol.2019.4501,2998606888,PMC6990953,0,000-175-292-391-976; 001-231-007-628-891; 001-600-823-666-344; 001-842-445-185-392; 001-979-158-522-218; 002-000-440-764-665; 004-034-590-035-319; 005-392-192-789-832; 005-508-298-446-75X; 006-282-054-529-10X; 009-590-041-957-272; 010-430-704-421-94X; 011-356-166-517-103; 011-377-771-641-340; 013-469-831-767-190; 015-229-658-526-624; 015-807-339-726-321; 017-090-921-812-599; 017-776-994-365-036; 019-166-239-301-818; 022-868-390-905-758; 023-242-262-165-398; 023-441-921-298-672; 023-446-974-754-304; 026-744-790-713-553; 026-783-284-954-233; 027-173-148-595-481; 028-132-224-915-21X; 028-866-827-772-791; 030-418-396-955-467; 032-449-033-433-55X; 034-452-916-276-869; 040-351-089-971-781; 041-688-054-850-816; 044-979-737-288-948; 047-229-751-696-557; 049-901-626-772-835; 054-882-188-538-060; 059-964-163-231-020; 060-503-884-327-712; 069-570-589-924-52X; 075-913-464-269-452; 079-242-182-015-148; 086-783-712-170-643; 087-545-297-289-85X; 091-132-302-468-481; 095-155-183-952-592; 096-907-830-402-34X; 099-365-047-419-524; 109-607-140-456-688; 122-015-482-036-343; 123-696-064-898-728; 125-170-138-736-796; 128-660-448-382-875; 141-717-420-218-753; 154-400-050-577-666; 174-715-327-726-866; 188-792-942-718-89X,91,true,,green

T1w MRI scans are preprocessed in a standardized way comprising gray matter (GM) segmentation, normalization, modulation, and spatial smoothing. Resulting GM images are then compared to precomputed age- and sex-specific GM templates derived from the population-based Nathan Kline Institute Rockland Sample, and voxel-wise z-maps are compiled. z-maps are color-coded and fused with the subject’s T1w images. The rate of technical success of the proposed workflow was evaluated in 1330 subjects of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Furthermore, medial temporal atrophy (MTA) was assessed using the color-coded maps and with the MTA visual rating scale in these subjects. Sensitivities and specificity of color-coded maps and MTA scale were compared using McNemar’s test. One test dataset was excluded due to severe motion artifacts. Out of the remaining 1329 datasets, atrophy map generation was successful in 1323 ADNI subjects (99.5%). Sensitivity for AD diagnosis (71.4 % vs. 53.3%, p < 0.0001 for left; 70.4% vs. 55.3%, p < 0.0001 for right hemisphere) and for MCI (45.4% vs. 17.4, p < 0.0001 for left; 43.5% vs. 14.6%, p < 0.0001 for right hemisphere) based on medial temporal atrophy assessment in color-coded maps was significantly higher than for MTA visual rating scale, while specificity was lower (78.4% vs. 93.8%, p < 0.0001 for left; 79.4% vs. 95.8%, p < 0.0001 for right hemisphere). The workflow is named veganbagel and is published as open-source software with an integrated PACS interface. Automated brain volume change estimation with the proposed workflow is feasible and technically dependable. It provides high potential for radiologic assessment of brain volume changes and neurodegenerative diseases. • A workflow combining techniques from voxel-based morphometry and population-based neuroimaging data is feasible and technically highly dependable.;  • The workflow is provided as open-source software, named veganbagel.;  • Sensitivity of medial temporal atrophy assessment in atrophy maps from veganbagel exceeds the sensitivity of MTA visual rating scale for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.",31,2,1043,1048,Radiology; Magnetic resonance imaging; McNemar's test; Neuroradiology; Atrophy; Population; Voxel; Neuroimaging; Brain size; Medicine,Atrophy; Brain; Gray matter; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases,Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging; Atrophy/pathology; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neurodegenerative Diseases/diagnostic imaging; Workflow,,NIA NIH HHS (U01 AG024904) United States,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00330-020-07196-8.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7813701/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00330-020-07196-8 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32852588/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32852588 https://inis.iaea.org/Search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:52044358,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07196-8,32852588,10.1007/s00330-020-07196-8,3080188930,PMC7813701,0,004-760-561-337-787; 008-172-052-164-093; 008-989-867-184-42X; 011-417-409-425-497; 021-047-409-056-748; 024-109-558-931-542; 026-273-791-733-355; 028-804-023-397-312; 037-600-013-760-933; 038-695-280-115-745; 040-907-571-596-423; 053-559-671-458-769; 068-214-132-858-748; 078-931-794-929-802; 084-331-244-471-831; 086-139-820-487-632; 089-875-539-364-408; 110-190-021-928-771,13,true,cc-by,hybrid

That leads to the assumption of a dysfunction of; this area in schizophrenia patients, which often show positiv; symtoms like auditory halluzinations. Changes in cerebral asymmetry; and volume changes in schizophrenia patients have been described; several times in literature before.

Further we looked for an; asymmetry of the planum temporale and a proof for a possible; diagnosis specificity. With the Region-of-interest method and the; programme MRIcroN the planum temporale was manually marked on both; sides in each of the collective participants MRI. Afterwards the; volumes were measured and compared with the total brain volume,; with the controls and with the subgroup comparison of each; diagnosis. In contrast to other studies, we could not find an; absolute or relative loss of volume in the planum temporale in; patients with first-episode schizophrenia compared to healthy; controls. Also, the other diagnosis groups showed no significant; volume change in PT in comparison with healthy controls. However, a; significant inverted asymmetry was shown in the PT in patients with; a first-episode schizophrenia.

Aditya; M.B. Sanjay Pande,"Abstract Background: Machine learning and data mining techniques have been successfully applied on MRI images for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD). But only a few studies have explored the possibility of AD detection from non-image data. These studies have applied traditional data visualization and classification algorithms. There is a need for new sophisticated learning algorithms, for detecting and quantifying the severity of AD by exploring the complex interactions between the features in AD subjects. Method: In this work, a supervised learning model to effectively capture the complex feature interactions, in the sample space of AD data, is presented for knowledge discovery. The discovered knowledge is further used to quantify the similarity of a test subject to the demented class. Results: Evaluation of the proposed model, on OASIS database of Alzheimer's subjects, validates the well established risk factors and identifiers for AD: Age, Socio-Economic Status, MMSE Score and Whole Brain Volume. The Test subjects are affiliated to either non-demented (ND) or AD class, with non-overlapping and measurable similarity indices: Female ND (CDR=0) [0.48–2.90], Female AD (CDR=0.5) [90.16–774.51], Female AD (CDR=1) [1633.90–7182.23], Female AD (CDR=2) [55258.51–66382.44], Male ND (CDR=0)[0.69–3.66], Male AD (CDR=0.5) [99.18–647.51] and Male AD (CDR=1) [3880.16–6519.40]. Conclusion: The outcome of the work clearly demonstrates that, supervised learning model can be used effectively to quantify the severity of AD on a standard measurable scale. This scale of distance can be used as a supplement for clinical dementia rating.",6,,28,35,Statistical classification; Machine learning; Knowledge extraction; Supervised learning; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Multifactor dimensionality reduction; Similarity measure; Dementia; Clinical Dementia Rating; Feature (machine learning),,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352914816300491 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914816300491,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2016.12.004,,10.1016/j.imu.2016.12.004,2567868713,,0,000-199-206-963-760; 005-832-969-429-26X; 008-395-997-584-925; 008-398-317-012-573; 009-773-242-304-237; 011-775-037-217-733; 012-797-501-343-850; 015-114-204-111-90X; 015-965-016-200-601; 021-641-733-138-835; 021-710-139-770-797; 025-509-300-420-381; 027-173-148-595-481; 029-080-285-234-439; 031-101-069-631-941; 031-649-871-431-190; 032-129-513-254-072; 032-537-650-828-848; 036-670-294-790-094; 040-333-457-940-278; 043-620-913-216-293; 049-618-132-018-214; 056-155-229-779-605; 057-137-654-505-880; 058-690-794-989-688; 059-915-293-864-546; 069-206-007-921-935; 072-476-440-617-22X; 074-034-357-539-739; 074-496-871-320-699; 074-696-804-322-869; 077-273-307-091-97X; 079-080-927-033-553; 088-595-714-868-804; 095-783-296-929-951; 099-650-615-209-617; 110-190-021-928-771; 125-200-548-481-516; 129-000-904-596-942; 131-756-174-644-245; 142-338-895-686-24X; 151-759-653-071-754,11,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Y.)",23528737,Elsevier Inc.,United States,null Basheera; M. Satya Sai Ram,"In recent times, accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plays a vital role in patient care and further treatment. Predicting AD from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitive normal (CN) has become popular. Neuroimaging and computer-aided diagnosis techniques are used for classification of AD by physicians in the early stage. Most of the previous machine learning techniques work on handpicked features. In the recent days, deep learning has been applied for many medical image applications. Existing deep learning systems work on raw magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images and cortical surface as an input to the convolution neural network (CNN) to perform classification of AD. AD affects the brain volume and changes the gray matter texture. In our work, we used 1820 T2-weighted brain magnetic resonance volumes including 635 AD MRIs, 548 MCI MRIs, and 637 CN MRIs, sliced into 18,017 voxels. We proposed an approach to extract the gray matter from brain voxels and perform the classification using the CNN. A Gaussian filter is used to enhance the voxels, and skull stripping algorithm is used to remove the irrelevant tissues from enhanced voxels. Then, those voxels are segmented by hybrid enhanced independent component analysis. Segmented gray matter is used as an input to the CNN. We performed clinical valuation using our proposed approach and achieved 90.47% accuracy, 86.66% of recall, and 92.59% precision.",5,1,974,986,Deep learning; Magnetic resonance imaging; Artificial intelligence; Pattern recognition; Computer science; Independent component analysis; Voxel; Neuroimaging; Mixture model; Gaussian filter; Convolutional neural network,Alzheimer's disease; CNN; Clinical evaluation; Gaussian Mixture model; Independent component analysis,,,,https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.trci.2019.10.001 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6944731/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352873719300812#! https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352873719300812 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.trci.2019.10.001 https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/j.trci.2019.10.001 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Sai%20Ram%20MS%5BAuthor%5D https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6944731/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trci.2019.10.001,31921971,10.1016/j.trci.2019.10.001,2997873617,PMC6944731,0,001-471-286-409-431; 003-289-568-705-580; 005-074-037-218-761; 006-053-624-276-257; 006-434-140-087-870; 009-299-923-666-254; 010-979-234-926-860; 014-021-093-858-277; 014-360-501-635-045; 022-077-587-016-769; 023-687-174-943-083; 023-766-389-989-308; 027-011-592-414-382; 027-036-274-553-601; 030-864-881-167-325; 032-814-640-084-761; 037-340-241-688-955; 037-657-070-860-516; 037-973-840-100-981; 040-302-446-369-828; 061-168-341-729-687; 064-639-913-508-44X; 072-610-588-056-89X; 075-073-370-762-079; 088-078-146-918-061; 095-501-783-999-502; 107-291-256-113-547; 107-770-160-319-397; 110-628-449-571-340; 116-661-460-406-488; 128-724-337-202-966; 198-898-237-902-77X,74,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Jack,"Objective To test the hypothesis that beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden is associated with rates of brain atrophy. Methods Forty-five subjects who had been prospectively studied, died, and had an autopsy diagnosis of low, intermediate, or high probability of Alzheimer's disease who had two volumetric head magnetic resonance imaging scans were identified. Compact and total (compact + diffuse) Abeta burden was measured using a computerized image analyzer with software program to detect the proportion of gray matter occupied by Abeta. Visual ratings of Abeta burden were also performed. The boundary shift integral was used to calculate change over time in whole-brain and ventricular volume. All boundary shift integral results were annualized by adjusting for scan interval. Demographics, cognitive measures, clinical diagnoses, apolipoprotein E genotype, neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology, and vascular lesion burden were determined. Results There was no correlation between compact or total Abeta burden, or visual Abeta ratings, and rates of brain loss or ventricular expansion in all subjects. However, significant correlations were observed between rates of brain loss and age, Braak NFT stage, and change over time in cognitive measures. These features also correlated with rates of ventricular expansion. The rates of brain loss and ventricular expansion were greater in demented compared with nondemented subjects. Interpretation These findings suggest that rate of brain volume loss is not determined by the amount of insoluble Abeta in the gray matter.",63,2,204,212,Pathology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Prospective cohort study; Predictive value of tests; Neurofibrillary tangle; Lateral ventricles; Atrophy; Alzheimer's disease; Apolipoprotein E; Medicine,,"Age of Onset; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease/metabolism; Amyloid beta-Peptides/analysis; Apolipoproteins E/genetics; Atrophy/etiology; Autopsy; Brain/metabolism; Disease Progression; Female; Genotype; Humans; Lateral Ventricles/pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Plaque, Amyloid/metabolism; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors",Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoproteins E,NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG16574) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG11378) United States; NIA NIH HHS (U01 AG006786-23) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG016574) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (K12 HD49078) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG016574-090004) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG011378) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG011378-15) United States; NIA NIH HHS (U01 AG06786) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (K12 HD049078-01) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (K12 HD049078) United States; NIA NIH HHS (U01 AG006786) United States,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ana.21223 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2735194 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17894374/ https://mayoclinic.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/%CE%B2-amyloid-burden-is-not-associated-with-rates-of-brain-atrophy https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17894374,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ana.21223,17894374,10.1002/ana.21223,1966144812,PMC2735194,14,004-034-590-035-319; 005-200-931-452-880; 008-664-152-041-825; 012-037-496-349-411; 012-464-154-258-102; 013-403-326-197-498; 014-586-330-391-50X; 019-147-450-716-329; 019-383-783-432-660; 020-798-450-711-581; 021-057-999-742-869; 022-988-712-445-94X; 023-326-951-065-569; 023-795-290-727-941; 025-921-219-887-720; 028-240-160-037-689; 028-533-834-419-720; 032-643-176-342-742; 032-760-678-309-208; 033-131-077-610-112; 034-288-701-526-224; 034-628-292-879-683; 038-655-837-320-53X; 038-867-191-942-886; 038-984-701-228-459; 039-900-757-200-223; 045-760-852-977-810; 046-033-871-986-742; 048-536-112-681-339; 052-167-600-242-603; 054-312-280-120-236; 056-587-376-119-518; 058-447-936-385-864; 061-992-603-506-631; 064-724-443-122-337; 068-943-335-616-060; 069-586-017-396-422; 078-220-800-845-357; 092-005-296-671-217; 103-836-128-625-988; 104-280-849-848-79X; 116-958-675-137-534; 121-995-361-405-800; 123-976-738-883-183; 126-444-693-383-557; 128-096-037-397-023; 129-390-507-012-794; 131-980-245-229-134; 141-850-572-581-335; 143-993-123-144-894; 147-748-011-844-622; 189-255-811-304-016; 191-357-128-261-911,206,true,,green

In this work, we assembled a reference cohort of neuroimaging data from 82 sites (N=58,836; ages 2–100) and used normative modeling to characterize lifespan trajectories of cortical thickness and subcortical volume. Models are validated against a manually quality checked subset (N=24,354) and we provide an interface for transferring to new data sources. We showcase the clinical value by applying the models to a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample (N=1985), showing they can be used to quantify variability underlying multiple disorders whilst also refining case-control inferences. These models will be augmented with additional samples and imaging modalities as they become available. This provides a common reference platform to bind results from different studies and ultimately paves the way for personalized clinical decision-making. Editor's evaluation This manuscript is of broad interest to the neuroimaging community. It establishes a detailed reference model of human brain development and lifespan trajectories based on a very large data set, across many cortical and subcortical brain regions. The model not only explains substantial variability on test data, it also successfully uncovers individual differences on a database of psychiatric patients that, in addition to group-level analyses, may be critical for diagnosis, thereby demonstrating high clinical potential. It presents a clear overview of the data resource, including detailed evaluation metrics, and makes code, models and documentation directly available to the community. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72904.sa0 Decision letter Reviews on Sciety eLife's review process Introduction Since their introduction more than a century ago, normative growth charts have become fundamental tools in pediatric medicine and also in many other areas of anthropometry (Cole, 2012). They provide the ability to quantify individual variation against centiles of variation in a reference population, which shifts focus away from group-level (e.g., case-control) inferences to the level of the individual. This idea has been adopted and generalized in clinical neuroimaging, and normative modeling is now established as an effective technique for providing inferences at the level of the individual in neuroimaging studies (Marquand et al., 2016; Marquand et al., 2019). Although normative modeling can be used to estimate many different kinds of mappings—for example between behavioral scores and neurobiological readouts—normative models of brain development and aging are appealing considering that many brain disorders are grounded in atypical trajectories of brain development (Insel, 2014) and the association between cognitive decline and brain tissue in aging and neurodegenerative diseases (Jack et al., 2010; Karas et al., 2004). Indeed, normative modeling has been applied in many different clinical contexts, including charting the development of infants born pre-term (Dimitrova et al., 2020) and dissecting the biological heterogeneity across cohorts of individuals with different brain disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Bethlehem et al., 2020; Wolfers et al., 2021; Zabihi et al., 2019). A hurdle to the widespread application of normative modeling is a lack of well-defined reference models to quantify variability across the lifespan and to compare results from different studies. Such models should: (1) accurately model population variation across large samples; (2) be derived from widely accessible measures; (3) provide the ability to be updated as additional data come online, (4) be supported by easy-to-use software tools, and (5) should quantify brain development and aging at a high spatial resolution, so that different patterns of atypicality can be used to stratify cohorts and predict clinical outcomes with maximum spatial precision. Prior work on building normative modeling reference cohorts (Bethlehem et al., 2021) has achieved some of these aims (1–4), but has modeled only global features (i.e., total brain volume), which is useful for quantifying brain growth but has limited utility for the purpose of stratifying clinical cohorts (aim 5). The purpose of this paper is to introduce a set of reference models that satisfy all these criteria. To this end, we assemble a large neuroimaging data set (Table 1) from 58,836 individuals across 82 scan sites covering the human lifespan (aged 2–100, Figure 1A) and fit normative models for cortical thickness and subcortical volumes derived from Freesurfer (version 6.0). We show the clinical utility of these models in a large transdiagnostic psychiatric sample (N=1985, Figure 2). To maximize the utility of this contribution, we distribute model coefficients freely along with a set of software tools to enable researchers to derive subject-level predictions for new data sets against a set of common reference models.

These sex differences manifest as a shift in the mean in that the shape of these trajectories is the same for both sexes, as determined by sensitivity analyses where separate normative models were estimated for each sex.

Results We split the available data into training and test sets, stratifying by site (Table 1, Supplementary files 1 and 2). After careful quality checking procedures, we fit normative models using a set of covariates (age, sex, and fixed effects for site) to predict cortical thickness and subcortical volume for each parcel in a high-resolution atlas (Destrieux et al., 2010). We employed a warped Bayesian linear regression model to accurately model non-linear and non-Gaussian effects (Fraza et al., 2021), whilst accounting for scanner effects (Bayer et al., 2021; Kia et al., 2021). These models are summarized in Figure 1 and Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplements 1–3, and with an online interactive visualization tool for exploring the evaluation metrics across different test sets (overview of this tool shown in Video 1). The raw data used in these visualizations are available on GitHub (Rutherford, 2022a). Figure 3 with 3 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Evaluation metrics across all test sets. The distribution of evaluation metrics in four different test sets (full, mQC, patients, and transfer, see Materials and methods) separated into left and right hemispheres and subcortical regions, with the skew and excess kurtosis being measures that depict the accuracy of the estimated shape of the model, ideally both would be around zero. Note that kurtosis is highly sensitive to outlying samples. Overall, these models show that the models fit well in term of central tendency and variance (explained variance and MSLL) and model the shape of the distribution well in most regions (skew and kurtosis). Code and sample data for transferring these models to new sites not included in training is shared.

We validate our models with several careful procedures: first, we report out of sample metrics; second, we perform a supplementary analysis on a subset of participants for whom input data had undergone manual quality checking by an expert rater (Table 1 – mQC). Third, each model fit was evaluated using metrics (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplements 1–3) that quantify central tendency and distributional accuracy (Dinga et al., 2021; Fraza et al., 2021). We also estimated separate models for males and females, which indicate that sex effects are adequately modeled using a global offset. Finally, to facilitate independent validation, we packaged pretrained models and code for transferring to new samples into an open resource for use by the community and demonstrated how to transfer the models to new samples (i.e., data not present in the initial training set). Our models provide the opportunity for mapping the diverse trajectories of different brain areas. Several examples are shown in Figure 1C and D which align with known patterns of development and aging (Ducharme et al., 2016; Gogtay et al., 2004; Tamnes et al., 2010). Moreover, across the cortex and subcortex our model fits well, explaining up to 80% of the variance out of sample (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplements 1–3). A goal of this work is to develop normative models that can be applied to many different clinical conditions. To showcase this, we apply the model to a transdiagnostic psychiatric cohort (Table 1 – Clinical; Figure 2) resulting in personalized, whole-brain deviation maps that can be used to understand inter-individual variability (e.g., for stratification) and to quantify group separation (e.g., case-control effects). To demonstrate this, for each clinical group, we summarized the individual deviations within that group by computing the proportion of subjects that have deviations in each region and comparing to matched (same sites) controls in the test set (Figure 2B–C). Additionally, we performed case-control comparisons on the raw cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, and on the deviation maps (Figure 2D), again against a matched sample from the test set. This demonstrates the advantages of using normative models for investigating individual differences in psychiatry, that is, quantifying clinically relevant information at the level of each individual. For most diagnostic groups, the z-statistics derived from the normative deviations also provided stronger case-control effects than the raw data. This shows the importance of accurate modeling of population variance across multiple clinically relevant dimensions. The individual-level deviations provide complimentary information to the group effects, which aligns with previous work (Wolfers et al., 2018; Wolfers et al., 2020; Zabihi et al., 2020). We note that a detailed description of the clinical significance of our findings is beyond the scope of this work and will be presented separately. Discussion In this work, we create lifespan brain charts of cortical thickness and subcortical volume derived from structural MRI, to serve as reference models. Multiple data sets were joined to build a mega-site lifespan reference cohort to provide good coverage of the lifespan. We applied the reference cohort models to clinical data sets and demonstrated the benefits of normative modeling in addition to standard case-control comparisons. All models, including documentation and code, are made available to the research community. We also provide an example data set (that includes data from sites not in the training sample) along with the code to demonstrate how well our models can adapt to new sites, and how easy it is to transfer our pretrained models to users’ own data sets. We identify three main strengths of our approach. First, our large lifespan data set provides high anatomical specificity, necessary for discriminating between conditions, predicting outcomes, and stratifying subtypes. Second, our models are flexible in that they can model non-Gaussian distributions, can easily be transferred to new sites, and are built on validated analytical techniques and software tools (Fraza et al., 2021; Kia et al., 2021; Marquand et al., 2019). Third, we show the general utility of this work in that it provides the ability to map individual variation whilst also improving case-control inferences across multiple disorders. In recent work, a large consortium established lifespan brain charts that are complementary to our approach (Bethlehem et al., 2021). Benefits of their work include precisely quantifying brain growth using a large cohort, but they only provide estimates of four coarse global measures (e.g., total brain volume). While this can precisely quantify brain growth and aging this does not provide the ability to generate individualized fingerprints or to stratify clinical cohorts. In contrast, in this work, we focus on providing spatially specific estimates (188 different brain regions) across the post-natal lifespan which provides fine-grained anatomical estimates of deviation, offering an individualized perspective that can be used for clinical stratification. We demonstrate the transdiagnostic clinical value of our models (Figure 2) by showing how clinical variation is widespread in a fine-grain manner (e.g., not all individuals deviate in the same regions and not all disorders have the same characteristic patterns) and we facilitate clinical applications of our models by sharing tutorial code notebooks with sample data that can be run locally or online in a web browser. We also identify the limitations of this work. We view the word ‘normative’ as problematic. This language implies that there are normal and abnormal brains, a potentially problematic assumption. As indicated in Figure 2, there is considerable individual variability and heterogeneity among trajectories. We encourage the use of the phrase ‘reference cohort’ over ‘normative model’. In order to provide coverage of the lifespan the curated data set is based on aggregating existing data, meaning there is unavoidable sampling bias. Race, education, and socioeconomic variables were not fully available for all included data sets, however, given that data were compiled from research studies, they are likely samples drawn predominantly from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies (Henrich et al., 2010) and future work should account for these factors. The sampling bias of UKBiobank (Fry et al., 2017) is especially important for users to consider as UKBiobank data contributes 59% of the full sample. By sampling both healthy population samples and case-control studies, we achieve a reasonable estimate of variation across individuals, however, downstream analyses should consider the nature of the reference cohort and whether it is appropriate for the target sample. Second, we have relied on semi-automated quality control (QC) for the full sample which—despite a conservative choice of inclusion threshold—does not guarantee either that low-quality data were excluded or that the data were excluded are definitively excluded because of artifacts. We addressed this by comparing our full test set to a manually quality check data set and observed similar model performance. Also, Freesurfer was not adjusted for the very young age ranges (2–7 yo) thus caution should be used when interpreting the model on new data in this age range. Finally, although the models presented in this study are comprehensive, they are only the first step, and we will augment our repository with more diverse data, different features, and modeling advances as these become available. Materials and methods Data from 82 sites were combined to create the initial full sample. These sites are described in detail in Supplementary files 1-2, including the sample size, age (mean and standard deviation), and sex distribution of each site. Many sites were pulled from publicly available data sets including ABCD, ABIDE, ADHD200, CAMCAN, CMI-HBN, HCP-Aging, HCP-Development, HCP-Early Psychosis, HCP-Young Adult, IXI, NKI-RS, Oasis, OpenNeuro, PNC, SRPBS, and UKBiobank. For data sets that include repeated visits (i.e., ABCD and UKBiobank), only the first visit was included. Other included data come from studies conducted at the University of Michigan (Duval et al., 2018; Rutherford et al., 2020; Tomlinson et al., 2020; Tso et al., 2021; Weigard et al., 2021; Zucker et al., 2009), University of California Davis (Nordahl et al., 2020), University of Oslo (Nesvåg et al., 2017), King’s College London (Green et al., 2012; Lythe et al., 2015), and Amsterdam University Medical Center (Mocking et al., 2016). Full details regarding sample characteristics, diagnostic procedures, and acquisition protocols can be found in the publications associated with each of the studies. Equal sized training and testing data sets (split half) were created using scikit-learn’s train_test_split function, stratifying on the site variable. It is important to stratify based on site, not only study (Bethlehem et al., 2021), as many of the public studies (i.e., ABCD) include several sites, thus modeling study does not adequately address MRI scanner confounds. To test stability of the model performance, the full test set was randomly resampled 10 times and evaluation metrics were re-calculated on each split of the full test set (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). To show generalizability of the models to new data not included in training, we leveraged data from OpenNeuro.org (Markiewicz et al., 2021) to create a transfer data set (six sites, N=546, Supplementary file 3). This data are provided along with the code for transferring to walk users through how to apply these models to their own data. The clinical validation sample consisted of a subset of the full data set (described in detail in Figure 1A, Figure 2A and Supplementary file 1). Studies (sites) contributing clinical data included: Autism Brain Imaging Database Exchange (ABIDE GU, KKI, NYU, USM), ADHD200 (KKI, NYU), CNP, SRPBS (CIN, COI, KTT, KUT, HKH, HRC, HUH, SWA, UTO), Delta (AmsterdamUMC), Human Connectome Project Early Psychosis (HCP-EP BWH, IU, McL, MGH), KCL, University of Michigan Children Who Stutter (UMich_CWS), University of Michigan Social Anxiety Disorder (UMich_SAD), University of Michigan Schizophrenia Gaze Processing (UMich_SZG), and TOP (University of Oslo). In addition to the sample-specific inclusion criteria, inclusion criteria for the full sample were based on participants having basic demographic information (age and sex), a T1-weighted MRI volume, and Freesurfer output directories that include summary files that represent left and right hemisphere cortical thickness values of the Destrieux parcellation and subcortical volumetric values (aseg.stats, lh.aparc.a2009s.stats, and rh.aparc.a2009s.stats). Freesurfer image analysis suite (version 6.0) was used for cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation for all studies. The technical details of these procedures are described in prior publications (Dale et al., 1999; Fischl et al., 2002; Fischl and Dale, 2000). UK Biobank was the only study for which Freesurfer was not run by the authors. Freesurfer functions aparcstats2table and asegstats2table were run to extract cortical thickness from the Destrieux parcellation (Destrieux et al., 2010) and subcortical volume for all participants into CSV files. These files were inner merged with the demographic files, using Pandas, and NaN rows were dropped. QC is an important consideration for large samples and is an active research area (Alfaro-Almagro et al., 2018; Klapwijk et al., 2019; Rosen et al., 2018). We consider manual quality checking of images both prior to and after preprocessing to be the gold standard. However, this is labor intensive and prohibitive for very large samples. Therefore, in this work, we adopt a pragmatic and multi-pronged approach to QC. First, a subset of the full data set underwent manual quality checking (mQC) by author S.R. Papaya, a JavaScript-based image viewer. Manual quality checking was performed during December 2020 when the Netherlands was in full lockdown due to COVID-19 and S.R. was living alone in a new country with a lot of free time. Data included in this manual QC step was based on what was available at the time (Supplementary file 2). Later data sets that were included were not manually QC’d due to resource and time constraints. Scripts were used to initialize a manual QC session and track progress and organize ratings. All images (T1w volume and Freesurfer brain.finalsurfs) were put into JSON files that the mQC script would call when loading Papaya. Images were rated using a ‘pass/fail/flag’ scale and the rating was tracked in an automated manner using keyboard inputs (up arrow=pass, down arrow=fail, F key=flag, and left/right arrows were used to move through subjects). Each subject’s T1w volume was viewed in 3D volumetric space, with the Freesurfer brain.finalsurfs file as an overlay, to check for obvious quality issues such as excessive motion, ghosting or ringing artifacts. Example scripts used for quality checking and further instructions for using the manual QC environment can be found on GitHub(Rutherford, 2022c copy archived at swh:1:rev:70894691c74febe2a4d40ab0c84c50094b9e99ce). We relied on ABCD consortium QC procedures for the QC for this sample. The ABCD study data distributes a variable (freesqc01.txt; fsqc_qc = = 1/0) that represents manual quality checking (pass/fail) of the T1w volume and Freesurfer data, thus this data set was added into our manual quality checked data set bringing the sample size to 24,354 individuals passing manual quality checks. Note that QC was performed on the data prior to splitting of the data to assess generalizability. Although this has a reduced sample, we consider this to be a gold-standard sample in that every single scan has been checked manually. All inferences reported in this manuscript were validated against this sample. Second, for the full sample, we adopted an automated QC procedure that quantifies image quality based on the Freesurfer Euler Characteristic (EC), which has been shown to be an excellent proxy for manual labeling of scan quality (Monereo-Sánchez et al., 2021; Rosen et al., 2018) and is the most important feature in automated scan quality classifiers (Klapwijk et al., 2019). Since the distribution of the EC varies across sites, we adopt a simple approach that involves scaling and centering the distribution over the EC across sites and removing samples in the tail of the distribution (see Kia et al., 2021 for details). While any automated QC heuristic is by definition imperfect, we note that this is based on a conservative inclusion threshold such that only samples well into the tail of the EC distribution are excluded, which are likely to be caused by true topological defects rather than abnormalities due to any underlying pathology. We separated the evaluation metrics into full test set (relying on automated QC) and mQC test set in order to compare model performance between the two QC approaches and were pleased to notice that the evaluation metrics were nearly identical across the two methods. Normative modeling was run using python 3.8 and the PCNtoolkit package (version 0.20). Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) with likelihood warping was used to predict cortical thickness and subcortical volume from a vector of covariates (age, sex, and site). For a complete mathematical description and explanation of this implementation, see Fraza et al., 2021. Briefly, for each brain region of interest (cortical thickness or subcortical volume), y is predicted as: (1) y=wTϕx+ϵ where wT is the estimated weight vector, ϕx is a basis expansion of the of covariate vector x, consisting of a B-spline basis expansion (cubic spline with five evenly spaced knots) to model non-linear effects of age, and ϵ=η0,β a Gaussian noise distribution with mean zero and noise precision term β (the inverse variance). A likelihood warping approach (Rios and Tobar, 2019; Snelson et al., 2003) was used to model non-Gaussian effects. This involves applying a bijective non-linear warping function to the non-Gaussian response variables to map them to a Gaussian latent space where inference can be performed in closed form. We employed a ‘sinarcsinsh’ warping function, which is equivalent to the SHASH distribution commonly used in the generalized additive modeling literature (Jones and Pewsey, 2009) and which we have found to perform well in prior work (Dinga et al., 2021; Fraza et al., 2021). Site variation was modeled using fixed effects, which we have shown in prior work provides relatively good performance (Kia et al., 2021), although random effects for site may provide additional flexibility at higher computational cost. A fast numerical optimization algorithm was used to optimize hyperparameters (L-BFGS). Computational complexity of hyperparameter optimization was controlled by minimizing the negative log-likelihood. Deviation scores (Z-scores) are calculated for the n-th subject, and d-th brain area, in the test set as: (2) Znd=ynd−y^ndσd2+(σ∗2)d Where ynd is the true response, y^nd is the predicted mean, σd2 is the estimated noise variance (reflecting uncertainty in the data), and σ2d is the variance attributed to modeling uncertainty. Model fit for each brain region was evaluated by calculating the explained variance (which measures central tendency), the mean squared log-loss (MSLL, central tendency, and variance) plus skew and kurtosis of the deviation scores (2) which measures how well the shape of the regression function matches the data (Dinga et al., 2021). Note that for all models, we report out of sample metrics. To provide a summary of individual variation within each clinical group, deviation scores were summarized for each clinical group (Figure 2B–C) by first separating them into positive and negative deviations, counting how many subjects had an extreme deviation (positive extreme deviation defined as Z>2, negative extreme deviation as Z<−2) at a given ROI, and then dividing by the group size to show the percentage of individuals with extreme deviations at that brain area. Controls from the same sites as the patient groups were summarized in the same manner for comparison. We also performed classical case versus control group difference testing on the true data and on the deviation scores (Figure 2D) and thresholded results at a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate of p<0.05. Note that in both cases, we directly contrast each patient group to their matched controls to avoid nuisance variation confounding any reported effects (e.g., sampling characteristics and demographic differences). All pretrained models and code are shared online with straightforward directions for transferring to new sites and including an example transfer data set derived from several OpenNeuro.org data sets. Given a new set of data (e.g., sites not present in the training set), this is done by first applying the warp parameters estimating on the training data to the new data set, adjusting the mean and variance in the latent Gaussian space, then (if necessary) warping the adjusted data back to the original space, which is similar",,,,,Neuroimaging; Normative; Modalities; Computer science; Set (abstract data type); Population; Data science; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Machine learning; Medicine; Neuroscience; Social science; Philosophy; Environmental health; Epistemology; Sociology; Programming language,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.72904.sa0,,10.7554/elife.72904.sa0,,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

Carlson; M. M. Moore; Alison Dame; Diane B. Howieson; Lisa C. Silbert; Joseph F. Quinn; J. A. Kaye,"Background: The use of volumetric MRI as a biomarker for assessing transitions to dementia presumes that more rapid brain loss marks the clinical transition from benign aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The trajectory of this volume loss relative to the timing of the clinical transition to dementia has not been established. Methods: The authors annually evaluated 79 healthy elderly subjects for up to 15 consecutive years with standardized clinical examinations and volumetric brain MRI assessments of ventricular volume. During the study period, 37 subjects developed MCI. A mixed effects model with a change point modeled the pattern of brain volume loss in healthy aging compared with subjects diagnosed with MCI. Results: The brain loss trajectory of subjects developing MCI during follow-up differed from healthy aging in a two-phase process. First, the annual rate of expansion of ventricular volume decreased with age; however, the annual rates of expansion were greater in those who developed cognitive impairment during follow-up compared with those who did not. Further, subjects who developed MCI had an acceleration of ventricular volume expansion approximately 2.3 years prior to clinical diagnosis of MCI. Conclusions: Ventricular expansion is faster in those developing mild cognitive impairment years prior to clinical symptoms, and eventually a more rapid expansion occurs approximately 24 months prior to the emergence of clinical symptoms. These differential rates of preclinical atrophy suggest that there are specific windows for optimal timing of introduction of dementia prevention therapies in the future.

Using pair-wise measures between various features of each subject, manifold learning maps these features to a lower dimensional space, where they can be used for further analysis or classification. In this work, we build a joint PiB/MRI manifold to investigate longitudinal changes in Alzheimer's disease. Longitudinal PiB and T1W MRI images from the AIBL study were used (16 AD, 26 MCI and 138 NC). MR images were segmented, skull-striped and normalised to a canonical brain using a soft non-rigid registration. The segmentations and PiB images were then propagated to the canonical space. A cerebellum mask defined on the population atlas and masked by the GM segmentation was used to SUVR normalise each PiB images. To remove contrast variations due to differing MR scanners a composite MR image was generated from the GM, WM and CSF segmentations. Pair-wise Normalised Mutual Information was computed on the PiB and composite MR images, and the 2 affinity matrices summed to produce a joint PiB/MRI manifold embedding using Laplacian eigen-maps. The resulting embedding exhibits two preferential axes, with left-to-right increases the PiB retention, and top-to-bottom increases in atrophy. (Figure 1) Two preferential paths representing the evolution of the subjects in the cohort can be identified. One path (Fig 1 left) contains mostly NC and some MCI which don't show any PiB increase over time, but exhibit higher atrophy, which presumably correspond to subjects undergoing either normal ageing or non-Aβ related neurodegenerative process. The second path encompass a wider range of clinical classifications where subjects progress to the right as Aβ accumulates followed by a downward trend as atrophy increases. An unbiased PiB/MRI population model was developed to analyse the pattern of change in Aβ accumulation and brain volume over time. According to this model, the transition from PiB- to PiB+ appears to be independent of atrophy (but not age), which is consistent with a model of Aβ deposition preceding neurodegeneration.

Keynton; Ayman El-Baz,"Early diagnosis, playing an important role in preventing progress and treating the Alzheimer's disease (AD), is based on classification of features extracted from brain images. The features have to accurately capture main AD-related variations of anatomical brain structures, such as, e.g., ventricles size, hippocampus shape, cortical thickness, and brain volume. This paper proposed to predict the AD with a deep 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), which can learn generic features capturing AD biomarkers and adapt to different domain datasets. The 3D-CNN is built upon a 3D convolutional autoencoder, which is pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in structural brain MRI scans. Fully connected upper layers of the 3D-CNN are then fine-tuned for each task-specific AD classification. Experiments on the CADDementia MRI dataset with no skull-stripping preprocessing have shown our 3D-CNN outperforms several conventional classifiers by accuracy. Abilities of the 3D-CNN to generalize the features learnt and adapt to other domains have been validated on the ADNI dataset.",,,126,130,Autoencoder; Magnetic resonance imaging; Artificial intelligence; Pattern recognition; Computer science; Feature extraction; Brain size; Convolutional neural network; Adaptation (computer science); Machine learning; Brain mri,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1607.html#Hosseini-AslKE16 https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2016.7532332 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7532332 https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2016.7532332 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7532332/ http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2016.7532332 https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00455 http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00455,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icip.2016.7532332,,10.1109/icip.2016.7532332,2469941224; 3102185977,,0,001-471-286-409-431; 001-595-533-823-694; 003-084-473-636-296; 006-912-106-456-314; 007-165-107-777-662; 007-598-412-611-945; 008-671-257-256-465; 009-299-923-666-254; 011-872-557-104-702; 013-874-665-128-711; 015-810-431-349-036; 023-805-082-979-008; 025-964-694-586-003; 032-823-871-628-177; 035-187-410-897-686; 039-043-336-711-881; 040-234-043-478-876; 040-302-446-369-828; 048-536-112-681-339; 050-086-735-109-669; 051-904-098-021-004; 052-690-172-487-095; 056-664-397-988-006; 057-708-071-687-658; 062-164-469-480-962; 062-850-568-338-46X; 063-233-674-987-060; 074-649-950-617-751; 084-114-952-284-593; 087-032-610-246-044; 091-130-520-795-553; 096-225-634-190-978; 099-736-602-023-394; 110-612-203-376-602; 110-823-088-265-463; 113-981-482-178-328; 120-177-417-650-08X; 151-519-863-814-55X; 169-538-842-817-492; 172-858-772-859-689; 183-071-813-785-189; 187-227-499-756-198; 189-457-783-029-138,240,true,,green

Structural MRI studies and functional studies using FDG-PET and brain perfusion SPECT are widely used in diagnosis of AD. Outstanding progress in the diagnostic accuracy of these neuroimaging modalities has been obtained using statistical analysis on a voxel-by-voxel basis after spatial normalization of individual scans to a standardized brain-volume template instead of visual inspection or a conventional region of interest technique. In a very early stage of AD, this statistical approach revealed gray matter loss in medial temporal areas prominently in the entorhinal cortex and hypometabolism or hypoperfusion in the posterior cingulate cortex and precunei. These two findings might be related in view of anatomical knowledge that the regions are linked through the circuit of Papez. This statistical approach also offers a predictive value of conversion from MCI to AD and accurate evaluation of therapeutic effects on brain metabolism or perfusion. This development in functional and structural imaging might be an important surrogate marker for trials of disease-modifying agents.",7,3,118,124,Spatial normalization; Perfusion scanning; Psychology; Neuroscience; Posterior cingulate; Dementia; Entorhinal cortex; Differential diagnosis; Prodromal Stage; Neuroimaging,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1479-8301.2007.00175.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1479-8301.2007.00175.x,,10.1111/j.1479-8301.2007.00175.x,1990399816,,0,001-614-126-238-747; 001-707-658-598-607; 002-685-028-307-010; 003-841-796-239-936; 004-411-613-420-641; 004-772-459-688-837; 006-120-456-667-490; 006-186-136-684-680; 008-518-088-794-586; 010-437-091-845-484; 012-012-557-649-610; 013-254-719-429-329; 014-016-402-995-800; 015-120-808-394-219; 015-419-443-690-731; 016-085-763-519-668; 020-695-767-165-441; 021-447-040-227-692; 022-555-150-248-464; 023-912-601-191-604; 026-639-308-701-681; 028-605-780-005-572; 035-693-591-651-766; 038-695-280-115-745; 038-788-084-334-45X; 039-385-134-728-861; 040-125-933-501-65X; 040-153-671-953-450; 041-659-814-887-273; 055-417-368-268-435; 065-451-784-892-781; 065-638-782-492-135; 066-282-694-971-891; 071-302-202-665-350; 073-072-590-717-547; 079-214-262-663-622; 093-380-305-071-362; 094-776-753-813-638; 100-436-124-648-531; 105-383-074-770-605; 107-865-912-002-248; 124-098-271-794-776; 131-777-500-649-221; 164-208-814-606-360; 170-552-268-223-863,7,false,,

Background: The absence of markers for ante-mortem diagnosis of PSP and MSA results in these disorders’ being commonly mistaken for IPD. No neuroimaging modalities are specifically recommended for routine use in clinical practice in the differential diagnosis between IPD and these parkinson plus syndromes. Design/Methods: Internationally established operational criteria were used to assess the diagnoses of MSA, PSP and IPD. Ten healthy controls, 20 IPD, 39 PSP and 41 MSA patients were studied using the Structural Imaging Evaluation with Normalization of Atrophy (SIENA). SIENA is a MRI-based algorithm that quantifies brain tissue volume and does not requiere radiotracers. SIENA has been shown to have 0.5% brain volume accuracy in longitudinal studies. Results: There were no significant differences in age, gender and disease duration between IPD and these parkinson plus variants. In controls, the a-WBAR was 0.37%±0.28 (CI 95% 0.17–0.57), while in IPD a-WBAR was 0.5%± 0.38 (CI 95% 0.32–0.68). The IPD patients did not differ from the controls. In PSP, the a-WBAR was 1.9% ± 1.15 (CI 95% 1.37–1.93). In MSA a-WBAR was 1.65 % ± 0.9 (CI 95% 1.5–2.2). MSA did not differ from PSP. The a-WBAR in PSP and MSA were significantly higher than in the IPD group (p 0.6% differentiated patients with PSA and MSA from those with IPD with 91% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Conclusions: a-WBAR within normal range is unlikely to be observed in PSP or MSA. a-WBAR may add a potential retrospective application to improve the diagnostic accuracy of MSA and PSP vs. IPD, particularly in the initial stages, when ‘plus syndrome’ has not yet clinically emerged.

The present study aims to investigate the impact of NBVRs on the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementia disorders in real-world clinical practice. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively analyzed data of 112 memory clinic patients, who were consecutively referred for MRI and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) during a 12-month period. Structural MRI was assessed by two residents with 2 and 3 years of neuroimaging experience. Statements and diagnostic confidence regarding the presence of a neurodegenerative disorder in general (first level) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pattern in particular (second level) were recorded without and with NBVR information. FDG-PET served as the reference standard. <b>Results:</b> Overall, despite a trend towards increased accuracy, the impact of NBVRs on diagnostic accuracy was low and non-significant. We found a significant drop of sensitivity (0.75-0.58; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and increase of specificity (0.62-0.85; <i>p</i> < 0.001) for rater 1 at identifying patients with neurodegenerative dementia disorders. Diagnostic confidence increased for rater 2 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> Overall, NBVRs had a limited impact on diagnostic accuracy in real-world clinical practice. Potentially, NBVR might increase diagnostic specificity and confidence of neuroradiology residents. To this end, a well-defined framework for integration of NBVR in the diagnostic process and improved algorithms of NBVR generation are essential.",14,,971863,,Neuroradiology; Dementia; Medicine; Neuroimaging; Diagnostic accuracy; Confidence interval; Clinical Practice; Neurology; Frontotemporal dementia; Magnetic resonance imaging; Disease; Pediatrics; Radiology; Psychiatry; Internal medicine; Physical therapy,Alzheimer’s disease; artificial intelligence—AI; biomarkers; magnetic resonance imaging; neurodegenerative disorder (NDD); positron-emission-tomography,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2022.971863/pdf https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2022.971863 https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1690892/document.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2022.971863,36313028,10.3389/fnagi.2022.971863,,PMC9597632,0,002-907-930-970-627; 005-060-098-391-966; 005-632-137-732-198; 005-693-125-797-014; 006-677-371-729-89X; 007-277-389-709-508; 010-122-506-255-261; 011-213-553-714-387; 012-335-820-050-493; 013-000-565-213-532; 018-659-781-980-012; 019-293-776-714-206; 021-727-746-573-26X; 023-132-231-219-034; 024-869-730-206-02X; 025-433-473-585-469; 031-591-810-742-164; 035-562-695-692-765; 036-259-317-032-131; 038-695-280-115-745; 039-799-752-133-793; 042-115-378-336-66X; 043-605-702-793-386; 055-100-981-389-766; 055-799-868-157-367; 057-182-004-743-695; 059-469-089-756-532; 062-061-819-555-708; 073-771-074-618-131; 074-690-075-549-141; 075-869-016-589-342; 084-453-487-065-34X; 090-866-105-299-654; 100-251-930-996-273; 110-297-753-610-531; 113-271-587-505-042,1,true,cc-by,gold

BRAIM can be used for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson, Alzheimer or Multiple Sclerosis and also for brain lesion diagnosis and monitoring. Methods The developed CAD system includes different user-friendly tools for segmenting and determining whole brain and brain structure volumes in an easy and accurate way. Specifically, three types of measurements can be performed: (1) total volume of white, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid; (2) brain structure volumes (volume of putamen, thalamus, hippocampus and caudate nucleus); and (3) brain lesion volumes. Results As a proof of concept, some study cases were analyzed with the presented system achieving promising results. In addition to be used to quantify treatment effectiveness in patients with brain lesions, it was demonstrated that BRAIM is able to classify a subject according to the brain volume measurements using as reference a healthy control database created for this purpose. Conclusions The CAD system presented in this paper simplifies the daily work of clinicians and provides them with objective and quantitative volume data for prospective and retrospective analyses.",145,,167,179,Radiology; Pathology; Magnetic resonance imaging; CAD; Computer-aided diagnosis; Putamen; Multiple sclerosis; Caudate nucleus; Brain segmentation; Brain size; Medicine,Brain lesions; Brain segmentation; CAD; Magnetic resonance imaging; Volumetric analysis,"Brain/diagnostic imaging; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neurodegenerative Diseases/diagnostic imaging; Organ Size",,Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnológico Industrial,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260716307842 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28552122 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/cmpb/cmpb145.html#MoralesBLGLN17 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28552122/ https://riunet.upv.es/handle/10251/148100 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.04.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.04.006,28552122,10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.04.006,2605520827,,0,001-619-376-398-121; 005-969-542-401-951; 007-314-488-407-943; 012-288-328-622-470; 014-161-353-070-641; 020-046-741-635-003; 024-739-870-335-901; 025-527-659-826-053; 026-928-507-528-296; 028-758-351-781-562; 030-478-757-760-003; 031-041-248-321-795; 034-711-385-678-554; 037-492-415-979-270; 038-842-922-801-075; 043-056-008-882-240; 043-798-520-417-391; 048-597-623-071-750; 049-383-077-237-444; 049-540-682-428-384; 056-786-008-411-525; 057-927-409-991-236; 060-202-250-104-446; 063-777-439-475-642; 065-277-072-045-786; 067-629-568-738-85X; 069-751-023-314-813; 075-646-449-858-001; 087-375-209-816-13X; 093-364-946-239-487; 103-877-240-489-171; 104-059-560-673-455; 114-848-562-442-145; 141-464-706-752-588; 146-005-836-540-478,9,true,cc-by-nc-nd,green

Díaz-Caneja; Laura Pina-Camacho; Joost Janssen; Celso Arango,"Abstract Background Studies on longitudinal brain volume changes in patients with early-onset psychosis (EOP) are particularly valuable for understanding the neurobiological basis of brain abnormalities associated with psychosis. However, findings have not been consistent across studies in this population. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis on progressive brain volume changes in children and adolescents with EOP. Methods A systematic literature search of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies comparing longitudinal brain volume changes in children and adolescents with EOP and healthy controls was conducted. The annualized rates of relative change in brain volume by region of interest (ROI) were used as raw data for the meta-analysis. The effect of age, sex, duration of illness, and specific diagnosis on volume change was also evaluated. Results Five original studies with 156 EOP patients (mean age at baseline MRI in the five studies ranged from 13.3 to 16.6 years, 67.31% males) and 163 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, with a mean duration of follow-up of 2.46 years (range 2.02–3.40), were included.

We used four different models of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Back-propagation (BP), Radial Basis Networks (RBF), Learning Vector Quantization Networks (LVQ) and Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN) to perform classification of patients of mild Alzheimer's disease vs. control subjects. Features are extracted from the brain volume data using Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) detection clusters. The voxel location detection clusters given by the VBM were applied to select the voxel values upon which the classification features were computed. We have evaluated feature vectors computed from the GM segmentation volumes using the VBM clusters as voxel selection masks. The study has been performed on MRI volumes of 98 females, after careful demographic selection from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database, which is a large number of subjects compared to current reported studies.",,,641,648,Machine learning; Radial basis function network; Probabilistic neural network; Artificial intelligence; Pattern recognition; Learning vector quantization; Computer science; Probabilistic logic; Artificial neural network; Voxel; Feature vector; Segmentation,,,,,https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-04394-9_78 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04394-9_78 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ideal/ideal2009.html#SavioGHGV09 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04394-9_78,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04394-9_78,,10.1007/978-3-642-04394-9_78,118779735,,0,001-471-286-409-431; 005-074-037-218-761; 005-877-129-341-133; 005-970-562-277-546; 020-258-505-706-687; 028-227-833-509-542; 038-695-280-115-745; 042-508-095-450-275; 045-210-201-864-98X; 048-003-408-716-906; 054-777-249-158-084; 056-155-229-779-605; 083-748-528-851-534; 087-068-978-281-782; 097-611-358-932-534; 099-358-106-701-63X; 110-628-449-571-340; 123-161-712-119-526; 131-777-500-649-221; 153-922-688-037-054; 157-535-800-629-996,40,false,,

The correlation between shrinking of the brain shape and decreasing volume also affects the change in texture shape. In this proposed study, a new feature descriptor called the Histogram of Oriented Gradients from Three Orthogonal of Planes (HOG-TOP) is proposed to extract the dynamic texture features of 3D MRI brain images. The extension of the local binary pattern is the complete local binary pattern of sign magnitude (CLBPSM) as a feature extraction method also introduced. Because the features were in a high dimensional space, then probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) is used as one method of dimensionality reduction method. Furthermore, the random forest classifier is used for binary classification of Alzheimer’s, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and normal. In the experimental results show that the 3D HOG-TOP features provide the highest sensitivity value compared to CLBPSM-TOP and hybrid feature for all classifications.",15,,457,462,Artificial intelligence; Random forest; Histogram of oriented gradients; Pattern recognition; Computer science; Feature extraction; Histogram; Binary classification; Dimensionality reduction; Feature (computer vision); Local binary patterns,,,,,https://scholar.ui.ac.id/en/publications/3d-hog-features-based-classification-using-mri-images-to-early-di https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ACISicis/ACISicis2018.html#SarwindaB18 https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icis/2018/08466524/13Jkr9zNRVq,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icis.2018.8466524,,10.1109/icis.2018.8466524,2894332006,,0,003-213-459-058-440; 008-508-113-612-045; 022-890-782-823-074; 037-147-828-724-99X; 037-340-241-688-955; 038-159-480-563-308; 048-796-136-363-854; 058-026-005-839-869; 089-370-645-222-119; 102-730-868-162-286; 149-949-227-139-563; 155-557-703-258-366,14,false,,

Methods: We studied 46 subjects with aMCI who progressed to AD (labeled aMCI-P), 46 CN, and 23 aMCI-S. All subjects must have had three or more serial MRI scans. Rates of brain shrinkage and ventricular expansion were measured across all available serial MRI scans in each subject. Change in volumes relative to the point at which subjects progressed to a clinical diagnosis of AD (the index date) was modeled in aMCI-P. Change in volumes relative to age was modeled in all three clinical groups. Results: In aMCI-P the change in pre to post index rate (i.e., acceleration) of ventricular expansion was 1.7 cm 3 /year, and acceleration in brain shrinkage was 5.3 cm 3 /year. Brain volume declined and ventricular volume increased in all three groups with age. Volume changes decelerated with increasing age in aMCI-P, and to a lesser extent in aMCI-S, but were linear in the matched CN. Among all subjects with aMCI, rates of atrophy were greater in apolipoprotein E e4 carriers than noncarriers. Conclusions: Rates of atrophy accelerate as individuals progress from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to typical late onset Alzheimer disease (AD). Rates of atrophy are greater in younger than older subjects with aMCI who progressed to AD and subjects with aMCI who did not progress. We did not find that atrophy rates varied with age in 70- to 90-year-old cognitively normal subjects.",70,19,1740,1752,Internal medicine; Magnetic resonance imaging; Psychology; Cardiology; Predictive value of tests; Amnesia; Cognitive disorder; Atrophy; Severity of illness; Alzheimer's disease; Brain size; Gerontology,,"Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging/pathology; Alzheimer Disease/pathology; Amnesia/pathology; Atrophy/pathology; Cognition Disorders/pathology; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Lateral Ventricles/pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors",,NIA NIH HHS (AG06786) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG016574) United States; NIA NIH HHS (U01 AG006786-22) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG016574-10) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG011378) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG011378-15) United States; NIA NIH HHS (AG11378) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R37 AG011378) United States; NIA NIH HHS (AG16574) United States; NIA NIH HHS (U01 AG006786) United States,https://n.neurology.org/content/70/19_Part_2/1740 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC2734477 https://n.neurology.org/content/70/19_Part_2/1740.abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2734477/ https://mayoclinic.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/atrophy-rates-accelerate-in-amnestic-mild-cognitive-impairment https://www.neurology.org/lookup/doi/10.1212/01.wnl.0000281688.77598.35 https://n.neurology.org/content/70/19_Part_2/1740.full.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000281688.77598.35,18032747,10.1212/01.wnl.0000281688.77598.35,2090220821,PMC2734477,1,000-237-235-476-296; 002-082-727-879-592; 002-301-149-850-866; 003-427-453-603-35X; 005-200-931-452-880; 005-832-969-429-26X; 006-034-350-246-101; 008-081-401-770-101; 009-773-242-304-237; 011-082-331-917-210; 012-991-932-833-148; 013-199-047-251-767; 013-519-661-451-398; 013-565-596-426-512; 018-590-390-998-466; 018-816-880-695-168; 022-321-534-473-933; 022-988-712-445-94X; 023-795-290-727-941; 028-087-057-539-076; 028-630-202-484-369; 031-757-875-510-134; 032-674-258-767-367; 033-767-915-419-151; 035-312-642-007-945; 038-842-922-801-075; 041-577-021-075-399; 043-435-214-251-300; 043-578-118-236-395; 044-077-869-992-774; 044-181-753-288-70X; 045-777-635-026-833; 045-789-741-987-222; 046-601-285-909-747; 048-869-838-609-681; 056-587-376-119-518; 058-302-074-935-772; 058-495-390-637-252; 058-998-297-793-335; 059-646-723-608-794; 059-664-042-629-10X; 059-915-293-864-546; 068-910-533-634-744; 068-943-335-616-060; 069-586-017-396-422; 072-929-791-081-85X; 074-227-623-719-371; 075-181-514-867-792; 077-273-307-091-97X; 077-663-357-847-839; 081-920-327-522-370; 083-020-890-325-455; 091-229-181-275-675; 091-709-100-857-124; 092-713-689-154-648; 098-168-875-743-830; 104-280-849-848-79X; 105-134-047-147-28X; 107-948-173-461-590; 109-906-486-131-071; 126-444-693-383-557; 131-980-245-229-134; 134-554-009-769-267; 143-176-794-115-138; 163-034-495-635-645; 163-614-125-673-899,165,true,,green

Schott,"Objective Imaging is recommended to support the clinical diagnoses of dementias, yet imaging research studies rarely have pathological confirmation of disease. This study aims to characterise patterns of brain volume loss in six primary pathologies compared with controls and to each other. Methods One hundred and eighty-six patients with a clinical diagnosis of dementia and histopathological confirmation of underlying pathology, and 73 healthy controls were included in this study. Voxel-based morphometry, based on ante-mortem T1-weighted MRI, was used to identify cross-sectional group differences in brain volume. Results Early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer’s disease exhibited different patterns of grey matter volume loss, with more extensive temporoparietal involvement in the early-onset group, and more focal medial temporal lobe loss in the late-onset group. The Presenilin-1 group had similar parietal involvement to the early-onset group with localised volume loss in the thalamus, medial temporal lobe and temporal neocortex. Lewy body pathology was associated with less extensive volume loss than the other pathologies, although precentral/postcentral gyri volume was reduced in comparison with other pathological groups. Tau and TDP43A pathologies demonstrated similar patterns of frontotemporal volume loss, although less extensive on the right in the 4-repeat-tau group, with greater parietal involvement in the TDP43A group. The TDP43C group demonstrated greater left anterior-temporal involvement. Conclusions Pathologically distinct dementias exhibit characteristic patterns of regional volume loss compared with controls and other dementias. Voxelwise differences identified in these cohorts highlight imaging signatures that may aid in the differentiation of dementia subtypes during life.

Koek,"Cerebrovascular lesions are suggested to promote the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). L acunar infarcts and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) may contribute to cognitive dysfunction by disrupting large-scale brain connectivity and thereby hamper information transfer between regions.We examined (1) whether vascular lesions are related to a less efficient structural brain network topology and (2) whether reduced global network efficiency is related to worse cognitive functioning in patients with early dementia. 51 patients (19 MCI, 23 AD, and 9 AD+vascular dementia, mean age 78 ± 7 years) were recruited via a memory clinic. All patients underwent a 3 Tesla MRI scan and cognitive assessment. Lacunar infarcts (yes/no) and WMH load were quantified using a visual rating scale. Brain volumes were automatically segmented and adjusted for intracranial volume. Di ffusion tensor imaging based tractography was used to reconstruct the brain network of each individual, followed by graph theoretical analyses. The number of fibers between two brain regions was used to determine the strength of a connection. Overall network efficiency was assessed by measures of local (mean s trength, clustering coefficient) and global (path length) connectivity. Lacunar infarcts were present in 53% of patients with MCI, 22% of patients with AD, and 56% of patients with AD+vascular dementia. WMH load did not differ between patient groups. Across all patients, the presence of lacunar infarcts and a higher WMH load were associated with reduced strength, increased path length, and decreased clustering coefficient of the network (P<0.05, Table 1 upper panel), indicating reduced brain connectivity in patients with cerebrovascular disease. These associations remained significant after adjusting for dementia diagnosis, total brain volume, and after normalizing the total number of fibers in the network. Less efficient network properties were associated with poorer performance on tests of information processing speed, attention, and memory (P<0.05, Table 1 lower panel). Vascular lesions were related to less efficient structural brain network topology in patients with early dementia. Disruption of large-scale brain connectivity by vascular lesions may contribute to the development of cognitive impairment. Visualization of a brain network reconstructed for each subject. Each sphere (node) represents a brain region according to a standardized template. The size and color of the nodes represents the centrality of the regions within the network. The opacity of the connections between brain regions (edges) represent the number of tracts or the ‘strength’ of the connection.",8,4S_Part_14,,,Dementia; Hyperintensity; Vascular dementia; Cardiology; Medicine; Clustering coefficient; Internal medicine; Cognition; Diffusion MRI; Magnetic resonance imaging; Disease; Psychology; Radiology; Psychiatry; Cluster analysis; Computer science; Machine learning,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2012.05.1436,,10.1016/j.jalz.2012.05.1436,,,0,,0,false,,

Recently developed tau PET imaging tracers are candidate biomarkers for diagnosis and staging of AD. OBJECTIVE We aimed to investigate the discriminative ability of 18F-THK5317 and 18F-flortaucipir tracers and brain atrophy at different stages of AD, and their respective associations with cognition. METHODS Two cohorts, each including 29 participants (healthy controls [HC], prodromal AD, and AD dementia patients), underwent 18F-THK5317 or 18F-flortaucipir PET, T1-weighted MRI, and neuropsychological assessment. For each subject, we quantified regional 18F-THK5317 and 18F-flortaucipir uptake within six bilateral and two composite regions of interest. We assessed global brain atrophy for each individual by quantifying the brain volume index, a measure of brain volume-to-cerebrospinal fluid ratio. We then quantified the discriminative ability of regional 18F-THK5317, 18F-flortaucipir, and brain volume index between diagnostic groups, and their associations with cognition in patients. RESULTS Both 18F-THK5317 and 18F-flortaucipir outperformed global brain atrophy in discriminating between HC and both prodromal AD and AD dementia groups. 18F-THK5317 provided the highest discriminative ability between HC and prodromal AD groups. 18F-flortaucipir performed best at discriminating between prodromal and dementia stages of AD. Across all patients, both tau tracers were predictive of RAVL learning, but only 18F-flortaucipir predicted MMSE. CONCLUSION Our results warrant further in vivo head-to-head and antemortem-postmortem evaluations.

This study evaluates the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to detect these changes and investigates the relationship between severity of clinical findings and degree of morphological change. This correlation may provide valuable information in early diagnosis of PD. METHODS: Sixteen patients with early stage PD, eight patients with advanced PD, and eight normal controls were studied by 3T magnetic resonance imaging. The whole brain volume and the volumes of the caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra were calculated on three-dimensional reconstructed images. RESULTS: Putamen volume was significantly diminished in patients with early PD and advanced PD compared with that in controls (P < 0.05), and the percentage of atrophy was 12.5 and 26.5%, respectively. The putamen volume was negatively correlated with Hoehn and Yahr staging (r = -0.720, P < 0.001). Pallidal volume was reduced only in advanced PD (P = 0.023). There were no significant differences in total brain, caudate, or substantia nigra among these three groups CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance imaging-based volumetric measurement is a sensitive method in the assessment of morphological changes of PD in vivo. The putamen atrophy was correlated with the severity of clinical findings. The volumetric measurement of putamen could potentially be a useful indicator of PD in the early stage.",58,2,256,262,Pathology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Basal ganglia; Central nervous system disease; Putamen; Parkinson's disease; Globus pallidus; Substantia nigra; Atrophy; Medicine,,Aged; Atrophy; Basal Ganglia/pathology; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Parkinson Disease/pathology; Putamen/pathology; Substantia Nigra/pathology,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16462479/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/16462479 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16462479 https://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article-abstract/58/2/256/2555164,http://dx.doi.org/10.1227/01.neu.0000194845.19462.7b,16462479,10.1227/01.neu.0000194845.19462.7b,2030994036,,0,002-004-470-664-612; 002-910-650-109-389; 004-113-418-507-332; 006-216-392-569-731; 006-593-033-000-352; 012-136-296-982-806; 012-915-515-677-32X; 013-153-141-464-247; 013-534-657-241-529; 016-084-569-508-055; 019-155-544-072-448; 019-920-515-110-519; 022-725-655-409-971; 024-088-579-076-768; 024-858-897-713-839; 030-631-019-201-072; 031-674-430-538-835; 040-993-275-096-727; 044-613-739-300-721; 050-257-124-426-087; 051-283-054-178-465; 056-866-396-023-160; 061-782-856-667-008; 075-408-782-838-684; 078-672-752-849-261; 078-732-802-813-948; 079-951-376-411-415; 083-739-599-831-659; 084-555-163-714-638; 090-879-206-501-877; 104-322-834-473-107; 112-168-762-402-824; 113-765-109-991-701,124,false,,

Cuesta; Jerónimo Saiz-Ruiz; Miguel Bernardo; Mara Parellada,"Brain volume and thickness abnormalities have been reported in first-episode psychosis (FEP). However, it is unclear if and how they are modulated by brain developmental stage (and, therefore, by age at FEP as a proxy). This is a multicenter cross-sectional case-control brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Patients with FEP (n = 196), 65.3% males, with a wide age at FEP span (12-35 y), and healthy controls (HC) (n = 157), matched for age, sex, and handedness, were scanned at 6 sites. Gray matter volume and thickness measurements were generated for several brain regions using FreeSurfer software. The nonlinear relationship between age at scan (a proxy for age at FEP in patients) and volume and thickness measurements was explored in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD), affective psychoses (AFP), and HC. Earlier SSD cases (ie, FEP before 15-20 y) showed significant volume and thickness deficits in frontal lobe, volume deficits in temporal lobe, and volume enlargements in ventricular system and basal ganglia. First-episode AFP patients had smaller cingulate cortex volume and thicker temporal cortex only at early age at FEP (before 18-20 y). The AFP group also had age-constant (12-35-y age span) volume enlargements in the frontal and parietal lobe. Our study suggests that age at first episode modulates the structural brain abnormalities found in FEP patients in a nonlinear and diagnosis-dependent manner. Future MRI studies should take these results into account when interpreting samples with different ages at onset and diagnosis.",42,2,344,357,Internal medicine; Psychology; Cardiology; Neuroscience; Frontal lobe; Age of onset; Parietal lobe; Temporal lobe; Cingulate cortex; First episode; Temporal cortex; Brain size,MRI; age at onset; bipolar disorder; cortical thickness; cortical volume; first-episode psychosis; schizophrenia,Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Age of Onset; Case-Control Studies; Cerebral Cortex/pathology; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Gray Matter/pathology; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Psychotic Disorders/pathology; Schizophrenia/pathology; Young Adult,,,https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/42/2/344/2518934 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26371339 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4753597/ https://core.ac.uk/download/45321512.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbv128,26371339,10.1093/schbul/sbv128,2212980290,PMC4753597,0,001-128-664-513-079; 001-616-403-322-365; 002-402-768-234-926; 002-980-627-738-594; 003-312-543-923-605; 004-255-879-847-333; 005-829-204-411-474; 005-862-271-738-420; 006-643-480-243-623; 007-637-141-362-930; 008-062-585-983-879; 010-458-214-786-131; 011-281-253-473-694; 012-283-495-843-278; 013-331-505-668-726; 013-822-247-968-510; 016-921-433-459-181; 021-792-229-877-493; 025-108-000-258-979; 026-051-526-402-199; 026-151-818-377-077; 026-806-986-889-56X; 028-870-663-446-368; 031-818-054-450-257; 033-620-120-989-576; 034-122-594-098-948; 034-288-701-526-224; 036-430-047-361-88X; 038-272-530-908-197; 038-759-441-462-001; 041-408-325-415-308; 051-142-659-136-357; 054-958-654-097-177; 056-909-964-126-617; 057-122-660-956-272; 058-673-796-390-295; 058-685-672-709-24X; 061-968-008-329-650; 063-061-099-718-21X; 064-040-694-736-774; 066-243-187-619-082; 066-951-484-651-203; 067-715-519-706-692; 067-773-694-641-131; 067-794-312-639-03X; 068-865-428-808-888; 071-837-453-239-007; 072-068-431-816-267; 081-604-844-050-397; 087-034-899-967-019; 118-103-537-962-244; 123-237-967-828-621; 150-325-162-873-23X; 151-243-278-557-05X; 169-466-823-220-359; 184-129-201-772-542,57,true,cc0,green

Several maladaptive traits characterize patients with this ""cluster B"" personality disorder, including impulsive aggression, affective lability, self-injury, and identity diffusion. They often maintain volatile relationships. This volatility causes significant social and occupational impairment and yields a lifetime suicide mortality rate of almost 10%—a rate 50 times higher than in the general population.3 Several recent publications review the diagnosis, prognosis, pathophysiology, and current treatment strategies for this debilitating condition.3–5 BPD afflicts 1% to 2% of the general population, up to 10% of psychiatric outpatients, and up to 20% of psychiatric inpatients. Clinicians diagnose it more often in women. A recent study of more than 40 twin pairs with BPD reported a concordance rate of 35% for monozygotics and almost 7% for dizygotics.6Many patients with BPD suffer from comorbid psychiatric conditions. A study that included 59 patients with BPD found that all but one had a concurrent axis I disorder, and almost 70% had three or more.7 Sixty-one percent of the patients met criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD), 35% for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 29% for panic disorder with agoraphobia, 20% for a somatoform disorder, and 13% for a substance use disorder. Another study found that of 240 patients with BPD, almost 40% were diagnosed with at least one mood disorder.8 Specifically, 31% met criteria for MDD, 16% for dysthymia, 9% for bipolar I, and 4% for bipolar II.NEURAL CIRCUITRY OF EMOTION REGULATIONOne common denominator to the various clinical phenotypes of BPD appears to be dysfunctional regulation of emotions. According to Lineham,9 individuals with BPD are characterized by high sensitivity to emotional stimuli, high emotional intensity, and slow return of emotional arousal to baseline. This theory is supported by a number of studies that indicate higher affective lability and higher affective intensity in subjects with BPD, as compared to individuals with other personality disorders.10,11 Emotion regulation involves the processing, amplification, maintenance, and attenuation of emotions generated from internal and/or environmental stimuli. Davidson et al.12 give an excellent overview of the present understanding of dysfunction in the neural circuitry of emotion regulation as it relates to impulsive aggression, a common feature of BPD. Evidence suggests that threatening or aversive stimuli activate the amygdala, which in turn activates the anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices. While the anterior cingulate may play a role in the cognitive evaluation/processing of mood and affect regulation, it has also been implicated in responses to conflict. The orbital prefrontal cortex appears to inhibit impulsive aggression by regulating the amygdala. Related prefrontal regions include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Figure 1, blue), which may integrate emotions with cognition, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Figure 1, yellow), which may involve general processing of emotions. Of note is that while some consider the ventromedial and orbital prefrontal cortices to be distinct regions (Figure 1, yellow and orange), they are often grouped as orbital prefrontal cortex in the psychiatric literature.13 In the psychiatric literature the anterior cingulate region includes not only the gyrus (Figure 1, dark pink) but also the adjacent medial prefrontal cortex (Figure 1, light pink).Prefrontal serotonergic neurotransmission may play a role in modulating amygdala-driven emotional behavior.12 A variety of data suggest that dysfunctional serotonergic regulation predisposes individuals to the emotional disinhibition and impulsive aggression responsible for many of the volatile behaviors seen in BPD. Recent studies investigating the neurophysiological and neuroanatomical components of emotion regulation in BPD have used a number of electrophysiological, structural, and functional modalities. While these studies have been few in number and mostly unreplicated, they suggest that dysfunction in the neural circuitry of emotion regulation plays an integral role in BPD.ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIESA recent focus for electrophysiological work in BPD has involved exploration of the relationship between BPD and MDD using sleep electroencephalography (EEG). While many of the initial sleep EEG studies did not differentiate between patients with and without comorbid MDD, more recent studies have taken this factor into account. These studies have evaluated several sleep parameters, including those of sleep continuity, non-REM sleep duration, and REM duration and latency. Both patients with BPD alone and those with MDD alone exhibited increased sleep latency and decreased total sleep time in three studies but not in a fourth.14–17 Two studies found decreased REM latency in both groups.14,16 Increased REM density may also be present,16,18 and the differences from normal may be greater in MDD than BPD.16The relationship between BPD and MDD therefore remains unclear. It has been suggested that some of these parameters may serve as markers of predilection to mood disorders.14,16 Whether there is a common biological origin for these two disorders is an open question.EEG has also been used to study the electrophysiological mechanisms of self-injurious behavior in BPD. Interestingly, it has been reported that about one-half of these patients deny feeling pain during self-inflicted injury.19 Some patients with depression also report decreased pain sensitivity. Given the high comorbidity between MDD and BPD, pain perception and mood regulation may be neurophysiologically correlated. To test this hypothesis, Russ et al.20 compared power spectrum analysis of EEG in patients with BPD who do not feel pain during self-injury (n = 19) to those who do (n = 22), as well as to patients with MDD (n = 15) and to controls. Participants were asked to place one hand in a 10°C water bath and verbally rate their level of pain every 15 seconds for 4 minutes. The study found that in patients with BPD who denied feeling pain, theta power significantly and inversely correlated with reported pain both at baseline and during the cold water bath. There was a similar trend for patients with BPD who did report pain, though this was not statistically significant. The authors commented that in other studies, some theta activity localizes to the anterior cingulate cortex, a region that has been associated with depersonalization.19 They suggested that this association may correlate with decreased pain sensitivity, which in turn may play a role in mitigating noxious stimuli. The study also found that theta power directly correlated with the number of dissociative experiences resulting from the stimuli, providing further evidence that pain perception and mood regulation could be neuroanatomically and neurochemically related.STRUCTURAL IMAGING STUDIESInitial structural imaging studies using computed tomography (CT) revealed no volumetric or asymmetric abnormalities in patients with BPD,21,22 other than a narrower third ventricle in healthy women and in those with BPD.23 The authors questioned the significance of this finding, however, as it could be attributable to females in general.Subsequent structural studies have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate BPD. Lyoo et al.24 measured cortical and ventricular volumes in patients with BPD (n = 25) and found 6.2% smaller frontal lobe volumes compared to control individuals. This study excluded patients with additional axis I or II diagnoses, which may render the results unrepresentative of BPD as a whole, given the high prevalence of comorbid disorders. Further, the study did not control for brain size.Subcortical structures have also been studied in patients with BPD. Driessen et al.25 measured hippocampal and amygdala volumes in patients with BPD reporting childhood physical or sexual abuse (n = 21), which are common in this disorder. While the study found no difference in whole brain volume between patients with BPD and controls, the patients had 16% smaller hippocampal volumes. A similar trend was found in the amygdala (8%), though this reduction was not statistically significant. These results concur with data from patients with PTSD from childhood abuse, suggesting that this decrease may correlate with traumatic experience rather than with BPD per se.26 Driessen et al. found no volume differences when they separated their patients with BPD by presence of PTSD. Of note is that the authors did not differentiate between patients who had an abusive background versus those who did not, nor did they consider comorbid MDD, which has also been associated with reductions in hippocampal volume.27FUNCTIONAL IMAGING STUDIESIn the following discussion, locations within the prefrontal cortex have been translated into three divisions most familiar to the psychiatric community (Figure 1).13 In some instances, the description used within the study is included for completeness.Functional MRI (fMRI) is a technique that localizes brain activity by imaging the influence of blood concentrations of deoxyhemoglobin, which alters signal through magnetic field changes. A recent fMRI study evaluated affective processing of women with BPD (n = 6) and no comorbid psychiatric illness or substance abuse while they viewed slides of emotionally aversive or neutral scenes.28 Increased activity in the amygdala (6/6), fusiform gyrus (6/6), orbital prefrontal region (4/ 6), and anterior cingulate region (3/6, referred to as the medial prefrontal gyrus) was found in the patients compared to controls (Figure 2). Both patients and controls showed activation of the temporo-occipital cortex. The authors noted that increased activation of the amygdala has also been reported in PTSD and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and may reflect the intense and prolonged emotions seen in BPD. Increased activation of the fusiform gyrus, which processes complex visual features such as facial expression, may be attributable to influence from the amygdala. The orbital prefrontal region directly connects to the amygdala and may modulate amygdala-driven emotional behavior.12 Enhanced prefrontal activation may therefore reflect cortical processing of the increased amygdala activity.Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ([1H]MRS) provides a measure of neuronal function. This technique generates signal by quantifying specified metabolites and plotting them on a spectrum. These metabolites include N-acetylaspartate (NAA, a marker of neuronal viability), choline (Cho, a neuronal membrane constituent), and creatinine (Cr, used as a standard due to its stable level). Signal may be expressed as a ratio of NAA or Cho to Cr or as an absolute quantification of metabolite concentration.A pilot [1H]MRS study in patients with BPD (n = 12) and no comorbid psychiatric illness assessed NAA concentration in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left striatum.29 Compared to controls, patients with BPD showed a significant (19%) reduction in absolute NAA concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal region. Striatal levels were also decreased, but the difference was not significant, and ratios of NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr were not significantly changed, emphasizing the value of obtaining absolute quantification of metabolites.Among the most widely used imaging techniques to measure brain activity is positron emission tomography (PET). This technique measures the signal of a radioactive tracer, such as [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), and represents it on a tomographic map. FDG is a glucose analog that is taken up into cells, including neurons, in the same manner as glucose. FDG cannot be metabolized, so it is trapped and thereby provides a measure of regional glucose metabolism. Various axis I disorders have demonstrated metabolic abnormalities, notably in the frontal lobes.30 In some studies, patients with OCD or panic disorder have demonstrated hypermetabolism compared to controls. In others, patients with mood disorders, alcoholism, or schizophrenia have shown hypometabolism.At least six studies have reported data on resting FDG uptake in patients with BPD. Among the first was De la Fuente et al.,31 who studied FDG uptake specifically in the temporal lobes of patients with BPD (n = 10). This region was selected to evaluate the theory that BPD may involve underlying epileptiform activity, as both patients with BPD and those with complex partial seizures share some common symptoms such as impulsivity. The study revealed no focal regions of asymmetry that would indicate an epileptic etiology, arguing against this theory.Five studies measured resting FDG uptake throughout the brain in patients with BPD. Siever et al.2 found no difference in uptake between patients with BPD and controls. Three studies reported decreased uptake relative to controls in the dorsolateral prefrontal region.30,32,33 Both increased and decreased uptake have been reported in the medial and ventrolateral prefrontal regions.30,32–34 One study reported decreased uptake in the orbital prefrontal region.32,33 Another found that decreased FDG uptake in this area correlated with a greater history of aggression.30 These findings support the theory that the orbital prefrontal region may modulate aggression through the inhibition of limbic regions (i.e., orbital prefrontal dysfunction results in limbic disinhibition).Two studies reported differences in subcortical areas. De la Fuente et al.32 found decreased uptake in the basal ganglia (caudate, lenticular nuclei, and ventral striatum) and thalamus. The anterior cingulate relays projections from higher-order sensory areas to other regions of the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia, which is thought to enable emotions to affect motor planning. The basal ganglia are involved in the control of motor and emotional behavior, and the thalamus connects these nuclei to the cerebral cortex. The authors noted that hypometabolism of the thalamus has also been shown in bipolar depression, OCD, and schizophrenia. Hypometabolism of the basal ganglia has been shown in unipolar and bipolar depression, generalized anxiety disorder, OCD, schizophrenia, and alcohol abuse. One limitation of this study is that it included patients with BPD who had past comorbid MDD and/or past substance abuse. Jeungling et al.,34 using statistical parametric mapping rather than regions-of-interest, found decreased uptake in the hippocampus but not the basal ganglia or thalamus. The authors noted that this might be due to decreased hippocampal volume, a possibility that requires further study.A variety of studies have linked reduced serotonergic activity with impulsivity and depressive symptoms, which are common in BPD (see review in Soloff et al.33). Two preliminary studies used d,l-fenfluramine (FEN) activated FDG to investigate possible serotonergic dysfunction in BPD.2,33 FEN is a serotonin-releasing agent, so a blunted response compared to placebo suggests reduced serotonergic activity. Both studies found an attenuated response to FEN in the orbital prefrontal region in patients relative to controls, supporting previous findings of dysfunction in this area. Siever et al.2 reported a blunted response in the dorsolateral prefrontal region, though Soloff et al. did not. Siever et al. found a blunted response in the anterior cingulate region and right superior parietal lobe. Soloff et al. found a similar response in the left temporal lobe, left parietal lobe, and left caudate. Of note is that while Soloff et al. studied only patients with BPD (n = 5), Siever et al. included patients (n = 6) who had overlapping diagnoses of borderline, paranoid, and histrionic personality disorders.Recent studies have used alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT) with PET to more directly evaluate serotonin synthesis capacity. AMT is converted to alpha-methylserotonin, which is not a substrate for monoamine oxidase and thus accumulates in the brain. This, in turn, may provide a more direct index of serotonin synthesis than previous techniques.35 Leyton et al.1 studied AMT accumulation in patients with BPD (n=13) in conjunction with a test of behavioral disinhibition. They found that the patients made more errors than controls on a go/no-go task, and AMT accumulation inversely correlated with impulsivity scores. Affected regions included the orbital prefrontal region, anterior cingulate region (including the medial prefrontal gyrus), temporal cortex, and caudate (Figure 3). The authors concluded that low serotonin synthesis capacity in the corticostriatal pathways may contribute to impulsivity in BPD. While none of the patients had MDD or substance abuse at the time of evaluation, several had additional cluster B personality disorders and/or a history of mood disorders or substance abuse.CONCLUSIONThese studies are consistent in revealing dysfunction of interconnected prefrontal, limbic, and corticostriatal pathways that work together to process emotions and modulate behavior. They support the theory that reduced serotonin neurotransmission among these structures lowers the threshold for behavioral disinhibition, possibly involving downstream neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid or dopamine.2 They further suggest a multifaceted etiology that accounts not only for the impulsivity of BPD but also for affective lability, dissociation, and comorbid mood disorders.While many of the individual findings from these studies do not appear to be unique to BPD, the combination may be, thereby producing its characteristic symptomatology. Differences in specific locations, boundaries, and laterality remain unclear but may relate to the few numbers of patients studied and myriad variations in approach and technique, making cross-comparisons challenging. Moreover, most of these studies have yet to be independently replicated and should therefore be considered exploratory. While not easily avoidable in BPD, many of these studies included patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders and substance abuse.Despite these limitations, however, the findings are provocative and encouraging. They require further research to replicate these results and clarify implications. Neuroimaging promises to play an integral role in solving the mystery of emotion regulation in BPD, which in turn may guide future treatment strategies. Cover.

Regions of importance in emotion regulation. Anterior cingulate cortex (dark pink), adjacent medial prefrontal cortex (light pink), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (yellow), orbital prefrontal cortex (orange), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (blue) are illustrated on diagrams of the brain. These interconnected structures work together to generate, process, and control emotions. Pathology in any of these regions or in the pathways connecting them may result in dysregulation of emotions.Figure 2. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) regional cerebral hemodynamic changes in patients with BPD after viewing emotionally aversive slides. Subtracting the difference in changes after viewing aversive versus neutral slides in seven female patients from the difference in seven female controls revealed activation of the amygdala (arrows, left image) and fusiform gyrus (arrow, right image) in the patients, as indicated on axial magnetic resonance images (threshold = 5.2, extent threshold = 7, p<0.001 uncorrected).Figure 3. Position emission tomography (PET) scans of a-[11C]methyl-l-tryptophan trapping in normal subjects (top row) compared to subjects with BPD (bottom row) indicate lower serotonin synthesis capacity in many regions, including medial, lateral, and orbital prefrontal cortex in BPD.From the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas (P.A.J., R.A.H.); the Mental Health Service Line, Salisbury Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Salisbury, North Carolina (R.A.H.); the Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec (C.B.); the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Rostock University, Rostock, Germany (S.C.H.), and the School of Health Information Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas (K.H.T.).

Subsequently, a subset of participants underwent 3‐Tesla brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify total and regional brain volumes, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, and white matter microstructural integrity (fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) as measured using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)).; ; Results; Of the 1,689 participants included (mean age at MRI 76±5), 72% were hospitalized, 14% had a major infection, and 4% had a critical illness during the surveillance period. Using covariate‐adjusted regression, hospitalization was associated with 0.12–standard deviation (SD) greater WMH volume (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.00–0.24) and poorer white matter microstructural integrity (0.17‐SD lower FA, 95% CI=–0.27 to –0.06; 0.16‐SD greater MD, 95% CI=0.07–0.25) than no hospitalization. There was a dose‐dependent relationship between number of hospitalizations, smaller brain volumes, and lower white matter integrity (p‐trends ≤.048). In hospitalized participants, critical illness was associated with smaller Alzheimer's disease (AD) signature region (–1.64 cm3, 95% CI=–3.16 to –0.12); major infection was associated with smaller AD signature region (–1.28 cm3, 95% CI=–2.21 to –0.35) and larger ventricular volume (3.79 cm3, 95% CI= 0.81–6.77).; ; Conclusions; Whereas all‐cause hospitalization was primarily associated with lower white matter integrity, critical illness and major infection were associated with smaller brain volume, particularly within regions implicated in AD.",66,10,1919,1926,Internal medicine; Diffusion MRI; Prospective cohort study; Dementia; White matter; Confidence interval; Risk factor; Brain size; Medicine; Fractional anisotropy,Alzheimer's disease; dementia; magnetic resonance imaging; risk factor,Adult; Aged; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Communicable Diseases/diagnostic imaging; Critical Illness/epidemiology; Diffusion Tensor Imaging/methods; Female; Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Prospective Studies; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; White Matter/diagnostic imaging,,"NHLBI NIH HHS (HHSN268201100012C) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (U01 HL096812) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (HHSN268201100010C) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (HHSN268201100007C) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (HHSN268201100011C) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (U01 HL096902) United States; NIA NIH HHS (K76 AG057020) United States; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (HL096917) International; NHLBI NIH HHS (U01 HL096814) United States; NIA NIH HHS (AG052573) United States; NCATS NIH HHS (UL1 TR003098) United States; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (R01-HL70825) International; NIA NIH HHS (T32 AG027668) United States; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (HL096814) International; NHLBI NIH HHS (HHSN268201100008C) United States; NCATS NIH HHS (UL1 TR001079) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (U01 HL096917) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (HHSN268201100006C) United States; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (HSN268201100009C) International; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (HL096902) International; NHLBI NIH HHS (HHSN268201100009C) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (R01 HL070825) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (HHSN268201100005C) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (U01 HL096899) United States; NIA NIH HHS (AG027668) United States; NCRR NIH HHS (1UL1TR001079) United States; NIA NIH HHS (K24 AG052573) United States; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (HL096899) International",https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6816230 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jgs.15470 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30251380/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30251380 https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jgs.15470 https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/association-of-hospitalization-critical-illness-and-infection-wit https://mayoclinic.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/association-of-hospitalization-critical-illness-and-infection-wit,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgs.15470,30251380,10.1111/jgs.15470,2893981402,PMC6181772,0,001-219-864-239-151; 003-248-637-497-498; 009-670-319-866-181; 012-180-796-100-062; 012-979-669-328-408; 014-350-704-922-459; 014-955-391-705-42X; 017-842-105-849-325; 021-952-542-753-454; 023-862-479-878-521; 025-861-159-821-647; 027-891-171-746-010; 030-242-948-237-249; 031-818-054-450-257; 032-330-914-506-028; 040-052-941-788-000; 040-287-892-661-156; 040-289-219-899-817; 044-732-356-187-954; 045-477-533-795-557; 046-409-755-518-901; 048-796-262-057-700; 053-320-346-380-887; 058-847-536-072-773; 059-095-284-723-556; 060-316-594-734-009; 061-525-384-434-005; 070-010-346-225-775; 072-096-590-739-332; 073-343-404-218-456; 076-113-122-595-152; 087-160-377-494-485; 087-545-297-289-85X; 093-682-292-457-314; 095-473-371-439-327; 123-603-034-402-466; 146-294-668-859-060,17,true,,green

Narayanaswamy; Monojit Debnath; Ganesan Venkatasubramanian,"Background: Differential susceptibility model hypothesizes that a genotype need not be unfavorable all the time as postulated in stress-diathesis model but can be beneficial in a supportive context. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs18000795) within the promoter region of interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene was earlier noted to have a differential susceptibility on hippocampal volume in schizophrenia (SCZ). Materials and Methods: We examined antipsychotic-naive/free SCZ patients (n = 35) in comparison with healthy controls (n = 68). Hippocampus volumes were assessed in 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging using voxel-based morphometry. Region of interest analysis was done using hippocampus mask. IL-6 SNP (rs1800795) was genotyped using TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. Results: A significantly deficient right (T = 3.03; KE= 392; PSVC-FWE= 0.04) and left (T = 3.03; KE= 47; Puncorr= 0.03) hippocampal gray matter volumes were noted in SCZ patients after controlling for the potential confounding effects of age, sex, and total brain volume. There was a significant diagnosis x rs1800795 genotype interaction involving both left (T = 2.17, KE= 95, Puncorr= 0.02) and right (T = 1.82, KE= 29, Puncorr= 0.04) hippocampal volumes.

One MRI per subject was processed by software packages from two proprietary manufacturers, producing two quantitative reports per subject. Two neuroradiologists assigned forced-choice diagnoses using only the normative volumetry data in these reports. They classified the volumetric profile as ""normal,"" or ""abnormal"", and if ""abnormal,"" they specified the most likely dementia subtype. Differences between the packages' clinical impact were assessed by comparing (1) agreement between diagnoses based on software output; (2) diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity; and (3) diagnostic confidence. Quantitative outputs were also compared to provide context to any diagnostic differences.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Diagnostic agreement between packages was moderate, for distinguishing normal and abnormal volumetry (K = .41-.43) and for specific diagnoses (K = .36-.38). However, each package yielded high inter-observer agreement when distinguishing normal and abnormal profiles (K = .73-.82). Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were not different between packages. Diagnostic confidence was different between packages for one rater. Whole brain intracranial volume output differed between software packages (10.73%, p &lt; .001), and normative regional data interpreted for diagnosis correlated weakly to moderately (r<sub>s</sub> = .12-.80).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Different artificial intelligence software packages for quantitative normative assessment of brain MRI can produce distinct effects at the level of clinical interpretation.

The AD and NC subjects, and the MCIs and MCIc subjects were matched in age, gender and education, respectively (Table 1). MTA‐scale was visually rated by an experienced neuroradiologist. Baseline T1‐weighted images were processed with AccuBrain to quantify the volume of hippocampus and ILV as well as the AD‐RAI.

This work aimed to find T1-weighted MRI-based markers for AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to improve the screening process.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"">Our assumption was to build a screening model that would be accessible and easy to use for physicians in their daily clinical routine.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">The multinomial logistic regression was used to detect status: AD, MCI, and normal control (NC) combined with the Bayesian information criterion for model selection. Several T1-weighted MRI-based radiomic features were considered explanatory variables in the prediction model.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The best radiomic predictor was the relative brain volume. The proposed method confirmed its quality by achieving a balanced accuracy of 95.18%, AUC of 93.25%, NPV of 97.93%, and PPV of 90.48% for classifying AD versus NC for the European DTI Study on Dementia (EDSD). The comparison of the two models: with the MMSE score only as an independent variable and corrected for the relative brain value and age, shows that the addition of the T1-weighted MRI-based biomarker improves the quality of MCI detection (AUC: 67.04% versus 71.08%) while maintaining quality for AD (AUC: 93.35% versus 93.25%). Additionally, among MCI patients predicted as AD inconsistently with the original diagnosis, 60% from ADNI and 76.47% from EDSD were re-diagnosed as AD within a 48-month follow-up. It shows that our model can detect AD patients a few years earlier than a standard medical diagnosis.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The created method is non-invasive, inexpensive, clinically accessible, and efficiently supports AD/MCI screening.</AbstractText>",92,3,941,957,Magnetic resonance imaging; Stage (stratigraphy); Cognitive impairment; Cognition; Disease; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Psychology; Mini–Mental State Examination; Medicine; Audiology; Psychiatry; Neuroscience; Internal medicine; Radiology; Paleontology; Biology,Alzheimer’s disease; magnetic resonance imaging; mild cognitive impairment; multinomial logistic regression,Humans; Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging; Bayes Theorem; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnostic imaging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods,,NIA NIH HHS (U01 AG024904) United States,https://content.iospress.com:443/download/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad220806?id=journal-of-alzheimers-disease%2Fjad220806 https://doi.org/10.3233/jad-220806,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/jad-220806,36806505,10.3233/jad-220806,,PMC10116132,0,002-266-060-883-361; 003-504-877-108-99X; 004-125-143-192-252; 012-951-528-778-099; 013-207-111-602-216; 014-133-332-681-891; 017-240-262-215-31X; 017-464-048-181-975; 017-606-064-077-618; 017-988-857-298-548; 020-443-359-096-116; 020-620-239-972-34X; 022-988-712-445-94X; 024-052-381-899-174; 024-057-283-597-837; 024-310-581-666-788; 025-706-224-812-30X; 028-938-354-899-02X; 029-621-267-783-310; 038-265-381-812-603; 040-679-200-945-215; 043-714-238-263-041; 045-351-436-495-655; 046-592-604-283-939; 047-855-703-268-96X; 050-840-068-875-627; 052-105-253-458-501; 052-933-889-043-073; 057-857-770-151-181; 060-130-071-018-980; 062-061-819-555-708; 065-150-371-353-510; 065-264-803-281-000; 067-549-975-913-432; 068-810-020-097-420; 073-171-356-321-791; 081-115-608-300-852; 081-684-917-007-107; 083-186-835-655-929; 089-180-298-372-624; 093-129-163-102-871; 094-114-190-526-500; 095-677-598-444-811; 095-713-856-250-426; 116-008-284-714-614; 120-878-974-076-625; 145-500-146-649-363; 171-373-946-483-123,4,true,other-oa,hybrid

Predicting conversion is clinically important as because novel drugs currently being developed require administration early in the disease process to be effective. Traditionally training data are labelled with discrete disease states; which may explain the limited accuracies obtained as labels are noisy due to the difficulty in providing a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer’s without post-mortem confirmation, and ignore the existence of a continuous spectrum of disease severity. Here, we dispense with discrete training labels and instead predict the loss of brain volume over one year, a quantity that can be repeatably and objectively measured with the boundary shift integral and is strongly correlated with conversion. The method combines MRI and PET image data and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels in an Bayesian multi-kernel learning framework. The resulting predicted atrophy separates converting and non-converting MCI subjects with 74.6 % accuracy, which compares well to state of the art methods despite a small training set size.",,,122,128,Artificial intelligence; Pattern recognition; Disease; Multikernel; Cerebrospinal fluid; Atrophy; Cognitive impairment; Disease severity; Computer science; Risk factor; Neuroimaging; Gaussian process; Biomarker (medicine),,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45174-9_13 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45174-9_13 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-45174-9_13 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45174-9_13/fulltext.html https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/nips/mlini2014.html#YoungMCAO14 https://core.ac.uk/display/159993424,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-45174-9_13,,10.1007/978-3-319-45174-9_13,2519022899,,0,006-785-653-384-912; 007-880-042-227-450; 009-731-680-573-255; 017-483-972-398-129; 023-014-725-113-97X; 038-712-567-690-669; 043-134-967-618-120; 048-063-143-915-137; 053-334-363-335-807; 075-772-222-149-451; 083-020-890-325-455; 093-990-140-679-588; 121-105-098-779-938,2,false,,

Wiste; Stephen D. Weigand; Leslie M. Shaw; John Q. Trojanowski; Michael W. Weiner; David S. Knopman; Ronald C. Petersen; Clifford R. Jack,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD) are the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau and neuritic plaques composed of β-amyloid (Aβ) fibrils. Biomarker and imaging indicators of disease that closely reflect the underlying pathology will add great value to clinical assessment as well as to the understanding of underlying mechanisms of AD. In this study we compared two core biochemical and imaging biomarkers, CSF and structural MRI. Two plasma cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in AD have been found to be promising: total tau (t-tau) and Aβ1-42. High CSF t-tau protein reflects neuronal and axonal neurodegeneration and Aβ1-42  is a major component of amyloid plaques and decrease of Aβ1-42  is thought to reflect deposition of soluble Aβ in neuritic plaques. Structural MRI captures disease related structural changes in the brain by measuring brain volume loss, the direct result of loss of neurons, synapses and supporting cellular structures. There is ample evidence supporting that MRI is an approximate in-vivo indicator of neuronal pathology in AD. A technique developed in our lab condenses the degree and location of AD related atrophy on the three dimensional T1-weighted MRI scan into a single number which is called STructural Abnormality iNDex (STAND)-score and correlates well with postmortem NFT Braak stages [1, 2]. In this work, we use STAND-scores as an indicator of the severity or stage of the AD-like pattern of volume loss on structural MRI. The aims of this work were two-fold in the context of evaluating both the biomarkers: cross-sectional clinical correlations and prediction of future clinical change. In this work, we examine both the aforementioned questions using data from the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study which consists of large database of normal elderly (CN), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD with both MRI and CSF biomarkers. RESULTS Cross Sectional Clinical Correlations: (a) Among all subjects, the correlation between STAND and cognitive scores was stronger than between the CSF and cognitive scores (p<0.01, Choi’s test), suggesting STAND is more closely related to cognitive performance than CSF biomarkers. When the subjects were split into groups by clinical diagnosis, there was no significant correlation between the CSF biomarkers and cognitive scores within any of the individual groups. However STAND-score correlated significantly with widely used indices of general cognition the Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes’ (CDR-SB) and the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) in the aMCI and AD groups suggesting that only structural MRI is closely related to within group variation in cognitive status in aMCI and AD. (b) Each of the MRI/CSF biomarkers independently contributed (p<0.001) to the prediction of clinical group membership (in univariate models). The model that combined STAND, t-tau and Aβ1-42, had better performance that any one disease indicator alone, the contribution of each disease indicator remained significant (p<0.001) and the biggest contributor in the combined model was STAND-scores.

Neuropsychological testing revealed impaired cognitive flexibility, figural memory, and verbal memory. Fluctuating cognitive abilities with deficits in attention-executive dysfunction and visuoconstruction also developed over time. A brain MRI showed reduced biparietal and cerebellar brain volume with generalized accentuation of the outer CSF spaces. The patient's CSF revealed anti-ARHGAP26 autoantibodies, which were also detectable in serum. In the differential complementary imaging diagnosis at 2 years, an FDG-PET revealed decreased occupancy of the posterior cingulum and precuneus. Although the FDG-PET, MRI, and clinical findings were potentially consistent with Alzheimer's disease, negative amyloid biomarkers in the CSF made an AD diagnosis highly unlikely. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [(123)I] N-omega-fluoropropyl-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-{4-iodophenyl}nortropane ([(123)I]FP-CIT) showed right-sided predominance, reduced dopamine transporter uptake in the putamen, consistent with a positive indicative biomarker finding typical of DLB. Considering the clinically probable DLB associated with the two core features of Parkinsonism and fluctuating cognition with deficits in attention, supported by an abundant tracer uptake in the right putamen and lower uptake in the left putamen on 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT as an indicative biomarker, we started an antidementia drug using a cholinesterase inhibitor.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""Conclusions"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Our report shows that atypical DLB may be associated with anti-ARHGAP26 autoantibodies, although their role and significance in the pathogenesis of DLB are unknown. However, it has to be mentioned that it is also possible that antibody-specific synthesis of anti-ARHGAP26 autoantibodies is a hallmark of a rare autoimmune disease that may cause the clinical and laboratory features involving altered dopamine transporter uptake on 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT, dementia, and mild Parkinson's symptoms rather than idiopathic DLB with only two core DLB features and inconsistent cognitive and imaging findings. Further research is needed to investigate the role of these autoantibodies in different dementias, particularly in DLB and mixed DLB-AD types.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2023 Hansen, Rentzsch, Hirschel, Wiltfang, Schott, Bartels, Lange and Bouter.</CopyrightInformation>",2,,1227823,,Dementia with Lewy bodies; Dementia; Pathology; Medicine; Psychology; Parkinsonism; Dopamine transporter; Internal medicine; Neuroscience; Dopaminergic; Disease; Dopamine,ARHGAP26 autoantibodies; Alzheimer's dementia; autoimmunity; cognition; dementia with Lewy bodies,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frdem.2023.1227823/pdf https://doi.org/10.3389/frdem.2023.1227823 https://publications.goettingen-research-online.de/bitstream/2/131160/1/frdem-02-1227823.pdf https://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?gro-2/131160 https://pub.dzne.de/record/268883/files/DZNE-2024-00382.pdf https://pub.dzne.de/search?p=id:%22DZNE-2024-00382%22,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frdem.2023.1227823,39081998,10.3389/frdem.2023.1227823,,PMC11285637,0,008-966-454-540-13X; 011-895-668-040-66X; 014-487-771-905-621; 019-041-040-471-386; 023-983-361-034-113; 026-198-217-285-650; 026-953-535-950-165; 029-309-044-487-294; 033-921-612-566-296; 035-465-062-730-528; 037-792-805-995-73X; 038-897-028-705-917; 047-455-653-717-567; 051-024-096-592-027; 055-342-476-115-088; 059-119-377-196-162; 070-367-511-779-23X; 075-759-006-476-144; 077-995-840-202-29X; 083-376-903-625-690; 083-907-322-281-682; 085-432-867-504-299; 088-492-035-391-184; 090-365-337-555-957; 094-293-412-643-603; 114-205-852-714-920; 128-268-111-174-812,0,true,cc-by,gold

Vivek; P.R. Anurenjan,"Here we propose a new method for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease from MRI images. The most prevalent, reliable and result-oriented methods for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease are: Firstly, measuring the rate of atrophy of the hippocampus and total brain volume; Secondly, extracting information from the gray matter, white matter and cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) of the brain. In this work, different statistical features such as contrast, homogeneity, correlation, energy and also shape features are extracted from the MRI images. For every image a number of features are extracted and these are fed to the classifier. The images are classified into any of the three classes: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Normal Control (NC).

Busatto; Breno S. Diniz; Marcus V. Zanetti,"Recent morphometric MRI studies have investigated brain volume abnormalities associated with the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). This technique allows the assessment of gray matter volumes in subjects with AD or related conditions compared with healthy controls in an automated fashion, across the whole brain. This article reviews VBM findings related to different AD stages and its prodrome, mild cognitive impairment. These findings include not only gray matter deficits in medial temporal structures as seen in former MRI studies of AD conducted using manual region-of-interest measurements, but also volume changes in several other brain regions not assessed in previous MRI studies. We also discuss potential applications of VBM to improve AD diagnostic accuracy in routine clinical practice. Finally, we highlight future research directions in this field, including: investigations on the relationship between VBM findings of multifocal gray matter deficits and changes ...",8,11,1691,1702,Psychology; Neuroscience; Voxel-based morphometry; Disease; Prodrome; Cognitive impairment; Mri studies; Voxel; Neuroimaging; Brain size,,"Alzheimer Disease/pathology; Brain/pathology; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods",,,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/18986240 https://doi.org/10.1586%2f14737175.8.11.1691 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1586/14737175.8.11.1691 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18986240/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18986240,http://dx.doi.org/10.1586/14737175.8.11.1691,18986240,10.1586/14737175.8.11.1691,2153021580,,0,000-933-962-041-44X; 001-168-112-394-936; 001-471-286-409-431; 001-614-126-238-747; 001-998-607-893-545; 002-213-514-487-672; 002-519-483-601-146; 003-233-503-217-268; 004-236-042-763-193; 004-615-343-305-292; 004-803-830-372-239; 005-074-037-218-761; 005-193-712-327-77X; 005-354-531-652-80X; 005-465-876-782-695; 005-771-117-987-281; 005-877-129-341-133; 005-896-254-058-998; 007-015-113-138-652; 008-989-867-184-42X; 009-253-828-771-60X; 010-064-717-123-266; 010-119-183-435-075; 010-220-408-673-899; 010-437-091-845-484; 010-711-620-955-152; 011-061-917-581-643; 011-407-892-996-556; 012-037-496-349-411; 012-085-893-002-143; 013-918-099-745-695; 014-050-827-791-765; 014-436-563-821-394; 014-820-692-686-623; 015-352-593-571-013; 015-589-381-033-833; 016-198-841-742-293; 018-122-655-829-178; 019-293-776-714-206; 019-669-344-628-542; 020-695-767-165-441; 020-913-608-347-275; 021-922-981-744-085; 022-241-837-632-102; 022-480-473-968-534; 022-788-129-458-755; 023-176-304-540-481; 023-795-290-727-941; 024-023-094-073-879; 024-673-312-456-064; 026-338-028-694-908; 028-154-289-679-85X; 028-637-178-694-607; 030-617-803-999-072; 030-701-526-614-761; 032-210-726-336-002; 034-048-995-839-898; 036-803-555-581-204; 037-975-376-941-89X; 038-695-280-115-745; 039-096-181-701-759; 040-824-325-494-284; 041-665-995-297-707; 042-263-463-964-542; 042-415-887-169-649; 042-508-095-450-275; 043-391-495-417-28X; 043-505-099-468-23X; 043-677-347-696-735; 044-001-468-239-81X; 044-255-780-800-069; 047-059-938-801-100; 047-637-300-584-794; 048-814-657-360-33X; 048-882-633-608-374; 049-614-198-002-17X; 051-277-999-532-362; 051-877-776-965-83X; 052-013-750-492-585; 053-741-717-436-17X; 055-566-928-260-589; 057-325-644-462-213; 062-110-228-616-052; 063-803-682-226-167; 064-181-546-190-377; 067-102-823-132-695; 068-214-132-858-748; 069-132-144-884-852; 071-053-303-582-680; 071-322-859-832-262; 075-869-016-589-342; 079-072-874-052-143; 080-451-162-446-246; 081-119-520-082-721; 081-362-789-529-522; 081-920-327-522-370; 083-874-133-262-257; 084-081-146-345-242; 087-019-970-379-469; 089-322-448-297-780; 091-690-271-961-949; 094-532-328-515-583; 094-724-862-171-254; 094-923-969-674-494; 097-731-830-445-796; 098-833-861-155-461; 099-879-987-878-227; 101-431-620-008-182; 103-107-175-980-27X; 103-421-739-982-98X; 109-887-763-159-89X; 111-083-610-679-008; 115-403-476-527-219; 116-213-991-702-519; 117-372-816-770-893; 119-415-728-361-029; 131-777-500-649-221; 147-285-090-437-276; 157-876-818-979-332,118,false,,

It was revised in 2017 (rFSRP) to reflect the modern data on vascular risk factors and stroke risk. OBJECTIVE This study examined the association between the rFSRP and cognitive and brain aging outcomes among participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set (UDS). METHODS Cross-sectional rFSRP was computed at baseline for 19,309 participants (mean age = 72.84, SD = 8.48) from the NACC-UDS [9,697 (50.2%) normal cognition, 4,705 (24.4%) MCI, 4,907 (25.4%) dementia]. Multivariable linear, logistic, or ordinal regressions examined the association between the rFSRP and diagnostic status, neuropsychological test performance, CDR® Sum of Boxes, as well as total brain volume (TBV), hippocampal volume (HCV), and log-transformed white matter hyperintensities (WMH) for an MRI subset (n = 1,196). Models controlled for age, sex, education, racial identity, APOEɛ4 status, and estimated intracranial volume for MRI models. RESULTS The mean rFSRP probability was 10.42% (min = 0.50%, max = 95.71%). Higher rFSRP scores corresponded to greater CDR Sum of Boxes (β= 0.02, p = 0.028) and worse performance on: Trail Making Test A (β= 0.05, p < 0.001) and B (β= 0.057, p < 0.001), and Digit Symbol (β= -0.058, p < 0.001). Higher rFSRP scores were associated with increased odds for a greater volume of log-transformed WMH (OR = 1.02 per quartile, p = 0.015). No associations were observed for diagnosis, episodic memory or language test scores, HCV, or TBV. CONCLUSION These results support the rFSRP as a useful metric to facilitate clinical research on the associations between cerebrovascular disease and cognitive and brain aging.",78,4,1393,1408,Framingham Risk Score; Internal medicine; Hyperintensity; Cognition; Neuropsychological test; Trail Making Test; Dementia; Stroke; Quartile; Medicine,Alzheimer’s disease; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular disease; framingham stroke risk profile; stroke risk,"Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use; Atrial Fibrillation/epidemiology; Blood Pressure; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction/epidemiology; Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology; Female; Hippocampus/diagnostic imaging; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Organ Size; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Smoking/epidemiology; Stroke/epidemiology",Antihypertensive Agents,NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG005142) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG010133) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (K23 NS102399) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG047266) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG008017) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG010161) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG025688) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG005133) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG047366) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG028383) United States; NCATS NIH HHS (UL1 TR001430) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG013854) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG053760) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG062428) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG010124) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG023501) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (L30 NS093634) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG054076) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG005146) United States; NIA NIH HHS (U24 AG072122) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG062421) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG035982) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG008702) United States; NIA NIH HHS (U01 AG016976) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (U01 NS093334) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG008051) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG005681) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG013846) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG047270) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG062429) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG005136) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG049638) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG012300) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG062422) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG016573) United States; NIA NIH HHS (K23 AG046377) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG005138) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG062715) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG010129) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7887636 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33164933 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33164933 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33164933/ https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad200803,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/jad-200803,33164933,10.3233/jad-200803,3094949226,PMC7887636,0,000-478-747-308-920; 002-231-326-252-795; 002-334-507-293-678; 003-172-344-071-583; 003-375-849-266-175; 003-645-283-146-816; 004-845-436-137-500; 004-878-186-027-069; 004-911-609-614-874; 006-221-673-829-399; 006-684-441-046-855; 006-707-977-347-946; 006-920-383-832-867; 007-016-497-616-071; 009-526-511-994-697; 010-156-343-145-900; 010-175-490-213-508; 010-673-030-525-350; 010-884-978-734-229; 011-758-320-007-868; 012-361-075-313-861; 016-466-431-716-947; 016-485-639-246-263; 017-024-282-911-834; 017-789-013-990-989; 018-860-733-379-753; 019-325-184-305-12X; 021-306-127-668-934; 022-605-867-043-573; 023-075-372-072-584; 023-723-202-769-832; 024-023-094-073-879; 025-531-446-047-867; 025-921-219-887-720; 026-744-790-713-553; 028-544-764-486-71X; 031-575-404-298-977; 037-627-787-919-418; 037-640-857-195-598; 038-954-951-435-226; 039-091-270-464-035; 039-433-483-310-985; 039-700-152-829-76X; 039-721-954-469-48X; 040-492-455-123-379; 040-649-027-911-654; 041-350-265-320-091; 041-603-188-230-393; 042-677-589-076-575; 043-351-065-277-516; 045-989-641-318-028; 048-536-112-681-339; 049-497-198-864-52X; 051-439-901-158-632; 052-690-172-487-095; 052-850-916-226-294; 054-756-385-777-768; 055-885-689-192-950; 055-958-323-268-783; 059-964-163-231-020; 060-348-704-260-390; 060-486-790-209-449; 060-665-248-955-728; 061-791-628-592-58X; 062-696-274-216-536; 065-978-922-568-383; 070-342-029-994-635; 073-536-461-962-186; 077-273-307-091-97X; 077-644-915-608-426; 079-081-362-888-355; 079-715-307-487-737; 081-301-220-455-718; 081-664-880-360-514; 087-292-224-963-572; 088-373-080-251-023; 091-853-660-919-043; 093-554-070-280-457; 105-790-989-628-47X; 110-310-017-569-335; 111-479-716-337-509; 112-302-513-318-431; 121-636-371-023-377; 133-460-424-795-258; 142-095-823-949-051; 145-834-518-516-896; 166-193-437-001-385; 166-897-579-267-870,4,true,,green

Six experimental settings are designed to compare single modality with multiview methods ‐ GCCA and DGCCA, see Figure 1. Agglomerative clustering was used to generated 2 clusters with features from each experiment.

Alexander,"We demonstrate the use of a probabilistic generative model to explore the biomarker changes occurring as Alzheimer's disease develops and progresses. We enhanced the recently introduced event-based model for use with a multi-modal sporadic disease data set. This allows us to determine the sequence in which Alzheimer's disease biomarkers become abnormal without reliance on a priori clinical diagnostic information or explicit biomarker cut points. The model also characterizes the uncertainty in the ordering and provides a natural patient staging system. Two hundred and eighty-five subjects (92 cognitively normal, 129 mild cognitive impairment, 64 Alzheimer's disease) were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with measurements of 14 Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers including cerebrospinal fluid proteins, regional magnetic resonance imaging brain volume and rates of atrophy measures, and cognitive test scores. We used the event-based model to determine the sequence of biomarker abnormality and its uncertainty in various population subgroups. We used patient stages assigned by the event-based model to discriminate cognitively normal subjects from those with Alzheimer's disease, and predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment. The model predicts that cerebrospinal fluid levels become abnormal first, followed by rates of atrophy, then cognitive test scores, and finally regional brain volumes. In amyloid-positive (cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β1-42 < 192 pg/ml) or APOE-positive (one or more APOE4 alleles) subjects, the model predicts with high confidence that the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers become abnormal in a distinct sequence: amyloid-β1-42, phosphorylated tau, total tau. However, in the broader population total tau and phosphorylated tau are found to be earlier cerebrospinal fluid markers than amyloid-β1-42, albeit with more uncertainty. The model's staging system strongly separates cognitively normal and Alzheimer's disease subjects (maximum classification accuracy of 99%), and predicts conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (maximum balanced accuracy of 77% over 3 years), and from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (maximum balanced accuracy of 76% over 5 years). By fitting Cox proportional hazards models, we find that baseline model stage is a significant risk factor for conversion from both mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (P = 2.06 × 10(-7)) and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (P = 0.033). The data-driven model we describe supports hypothetical models of biomarker ordering in amyloid-positive and APOE-positive subjects, but suggests that biomarker ordering in the wider population may diverge from this sequence. The model provides useful disease staging information across the full spectrum of disease progression, from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. This approach has broad application across neurodegenerative disease, providing insights into disease biology, as well as staging and prognostication.",137,9,2564,2577,Internal medicine; Oncology; Psychology; Neuroscience; Disease; Atrophy; Population; Proportional hazards model; Abnormality; Neuroimaging; Cognitive test; Biomarker (medicine),Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker ordering; biomarkers; disease progression; event-based model,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease/cerebrospinal fluid; Amyloid beta-Peptides/cerebrospinal fluid; Apolipoproteins E/cerebrospinal fluid; Biomarkers/cerebrospinal fluid; Cognitive Dysfunction/cerebrospinal fluid; Cross-Sectional Studies; Databases, Factual/trends; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Models, Neurological; Neuropsychological Tests; Peptide Fragments/cerebrospinal fluid; tau Proteins/cerebrospinal fluid",Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoproteins E; Biomarkers; Peptide Fragments; amyloid beta-protein (1-42); tau Proteins,NIA NIH HHS (U24 AG021886) United States; CIHR Canada; NIA NIH HHS (U01 AG024904) United States,https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/137/9/2564/2848155/A-data-driven-model-of-biomarker-changes-in https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1434616/ https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/137/9/2564/2848155 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4132648/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25012224/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4132648,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awu176,25012224,10.1093/brain/awu176,2136195493,PMC4132648,4,001-595-533-823-694; 001-642-927-716-890; 004-022-277-824-532; 008-664-152-041-825; 008-989-867-184-42X; 013-434-990-285-148; 013-552-296-781-157; 016-459-956-546-359; 016-781-011-490-187; 018-332-817-687-05X; 018-622-691-667-330; 019-552-565-904-791; 020-789-013-155-455; 020-798-450-711-581; 022-211-661-568-057; 023-993-466-895-103; 024-439-083-363-36X; 025-058-921-812-169; 030-939-031-439-623; 033-046-658-886-356; 034-684-957-401-112; 038-712-567-690-669; 043-363-355-681-347; 044-089-087-331-400; 048-405-858-082-332; 048-536-112-681-339; 058-495-390-637-252; 059-245-991-597-57X; 062-061-819-555-708; 069-334-870-913-764; 070-092-456-483-523; 075-599-400-982-774; 077-595-749-119-206; 078-661-934-444-202; 079-004-710-947-368; 079-253-530-896-310; 079-464-276-519-332; 083-900-147-550-379; 087-068-978-281-782; 087-545-297-289-85X; 090-917-665-223-022; 092-297-945-987-615; 094-618-380-090-831; 104-222-983-430-268; 106-074-889-628-332; 112-237-986-677-380; 113-988-814-358-790; 116-446-950-034-320; 122-909-738-105-764; 129-291-359-086-981; 153-394-495-065-351; 176-527-453-927-348,263,true,cc-by,hybrid

Karger AG,Switzerland,Rosie Watson; Andrew M. Blamire; John T. O'Brien,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) share common clinical, neuropsychological and pathological features. In clinical diagnosis, distinguishing between these conditions and other dementia subtypes such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be difficult. Despite the development of consensus diagnostic criteria, sensitivity for diagnosis remains low, especially outside specialist centres. Neuroimaging techniques using magnetic resonance (MR) can assess changes in structure, microstructure through diffusion tensor imaging and metabolism using spectroscopy and cerebral perfusion. Identification of such changes may contribute to our understanding of the disease process, assist in refining ante-mortem diagnosis and allow disease progression to be measured. This may be both clinically useful and a tool for assessing outcome in therapeutic trials. DLB and PDD share a similar pattern of MRI changes including global brain volume loss, a predominantly subcortical pattern of cerebral atrophy and structural preservation of the medial temporal lobe compared to AD. This review summarises the application and findings from MR studies in DLB and PDD to provide further insight into the similarities between the conditions, highlight the potential for the clinical application of MR techniques and outline promising areas for further research.",28,6,493,506,Magnetic resonance imaging; Diffusion MRI; Psychology; Neuroscience; Dementia with Lewy bodies; Lewy body; Dementia; Cerebral atrophy; Alzheimer's disease; Neuroimaging,,Aged; Atrophy/pathology; Cerebral Cortex/pathology; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Disease Progression; Humans; Lewy Body Disease/pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Protons; Temporal Lobe/pathology,Protons,Medical Research Council (G0400074) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G0502157) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G0900652) United Kingdom,https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/180562 https://psychiatry-training.wiki.otago.ac.nz/images/f/ff/Watson09.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19996594 https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/180562 https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1215338-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-lewy-body-dementias. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19996594/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000264614,19996594,10.1159/000264614,2069785803,,0,001-168-112-394-936; 001-813-795-208-141; 001-865-286-915-475; 002-711-652-059-088; 005-073-704-288-268; 006-593-033-000-352; 008-664-152-041-825; 008-772-927-023-592; 009-430-671-187-169; 009-775-398-953-750; 011-965-171-582-245; 013-429-297-457-427; 014-037-837-221-575; 014-489-967-104-542; 015-467-427-248-43X; 018-672-483-127-335; 019-920-515-110-519; 020-769-037-860-820; 021-939-535-113-92X; 022-507-148-431-52X; 022-788-129-458-755; 023-907-432-583-546; 024-394-922-432-543; 024-786-327-895-669; 025-123-473-633-965; 026-310-254-904-331; 027-340-184-031-945; 028-295-203-211-113; 028-645-622-212-388; 028-944-292-132-093; 029-319-902-294-683; 032-680-771-679-772; 036-296-479-327-170; 037-171-067-867-493; 039-389-378-880-411; 040-458-949-901-354; 040-531-496-847-436; 042-415-887-169-649; 043-351-065-277-516; 043-505-099-468-23X; 047-586-947-806-776; 048-700-504-207-785; 048-974-659-225-732; 050-539-295-176-815; 056-553-543-303-924; 056-866-396-023-160; 059-552-734-117-715; 061-762-055-323-16X; 061-892-774-534-073; 062-286-765-921-510; 063-877-811-793-654; 066-976-066-446-152; 067-963-638-059-11X; 068-562-067-303-893; 071-451-001-438-994; 071-596-106-524-01X; 072-475-339-788-388; 073-316-476-749-615; 077-917-440-455-390; 079-630-753-923-188; 081-310-438-561-85X; 098-310-919-601-960; 104-059-560-673-455; 108-465-457-354-113; 113-843-328-699-883; 122-775-522-632-986; 124-210-343-412-923; 132-511-228-439-791; 138-097-974-027-497; 166-391-751-082-31X,88,true,,bronze
067-721-480-350-836,When Mars Versus Venus is Not a Cliché: Gender Differences in the Neurobiology of Alzheimer’s Disease,2015-01-12,2015,journal article,Frontiers in neurology,16642295,Frontiers Media SA,Switzerland,Katherine A. Lin; P. Murali Doraiswamy,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a global public health threat with the prevalence projected to triple over the next 50 years. While substantial progress has been made in understanding the pathological timeline and developing biomarkers, one area remains relatively neglected: the disproportionate burden that women face. Women not only make up the majority of caregivers but also make up over two-thirds of Alzheimer’s patients (1, 2).; ; Currently, of the several thousand research studies published in the field of AD, only a tiny fraction are devoted specifically to sex differences. The higher prevalence of AD in women has traditionally been assumed to be due to longer female life expectancy. Differences in educational level, cognitive detection-biases, sex hormones, and genetics have been proposed as other possible causes for the gender imbalance. The literature has remained somewhat conflicting as to whether there is a higher age-adjusted incidence of AD in women with some studies finding no difference (3, 4) and others suggesting that women have a higher incidence (5–8). Perhaps, most striking is epidemiological evidence from the Framingham study, which reported that the age-specific lifetime risk of AD is nearly twofold greater in women than in men – 17.2 versus 9.1% at age 65 years and 28.5 versus 10.2% at age 75 years (6). This has sparked further attention into how gender may influence AD pathophysiology (2).; ; Cognitive tests commonly used to screen for AD or measure progression in routine practice (e.g., MMSE) are also known to show gender differences – suggesting that factors such as detection bias, cognitive reserve/education, or socio-cultural effects could potentially also contribute to gender differences in AD rates. For example, a meta-analyses of cognitive test scores in AD studies has found that women perform significantly worse than men (9). However, the emergence of biomarker tests, such as CSF, brain volumetric MRI, and amyloid and tau PET scans, has allowed for a more unbiased investigation of how gender affects pathology and neuronal loss at both preclinical and clinical stages of the disease. Selected studies indicative of gender differences in atrophy, pathology, longitudinal cognitive changes, and diagnostic progression in AD are summarized below.; ; Data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) have been used to examine gender differences in biomarkers and cognition. Hua et al. examined 1-year atrophy rates, using 3D-tensor based MRI morphometry in 1368 MRI scans (144 subjects with AD, 338 subjects with MCI, and 202 controls scanned twice) and found that annual atrophy rates were faster in women by 1–1.5% (10). Further, atrophy rates correlated with amyloid-beta and tau changes in CSF and with APOE4 allele status. Holland et al. (11) studied 668 subjects (normal, MCI, and AD) and examined gender effects on brain atrophy and cognitive decline (on ADAS-Cog and CDS-SB) over a 3-year-period in a linear mixed effects model controlling for age, education, ApoE4, and baseline cognition. In general, women showed greater atrophy rates and faster cognitive decline than men with the added contribution of female gender being equal to the magnitude of the ApoE4 effect.; ; In a longitudinal clinicopathologic study of 141 individuals with AD, MCI, or cognitive impairment, using clinical and post-mortem data, a significant correlation was found between gender and neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles after controlling for age (12). In the same investigation, each unit increase on a global measure of AD pathology was found to increase odds of clinical AD by 20-fold for women as opposed to 3-fold for men (12). With each additional unit of global AD pathology, the cognitive function scores in episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability were reduced significantly more in women than in men (12), suggesting a greater cognitive vulnerability to AD pathology in women, or greater cognitive reserve in men. In a separate study, steeper rates of cognitive decline, decreasing brain volume, and progression from MCI to AD, have been found in women (13).; ; Studies have also examined whether genetic and hormonal mechanisms contribute to the sex disparities in Alzheimer’s risk and pathology. Some have indicated a greater potency of the risk associated with APOE4 allele in women (14). Changes in fMRI default mode connectivity and increased CSF tau level in APOE4 carriers have been linked to female gender (15). Premature centromere separation (PCS), a consequence of chromosome instability, has been shown to be more common in both females with AD and normal females than in men (16), and in AD, the X-PCS phenotype is accelerated in women (17). Carriers of X-linked mutations show progressive neurodegeneration and ataxia with age (17); together with the finding of X-PCS predominance in AD, this suggests a susceptibility of the X-chromosome to AD-driven changes. Significantly, the AD brain demonstrates a twofold increase of X-chromosome aneuploidy rates in neural cells of the hippocampus and cerebrum, which are the brain areas most affected by neurodegeneration (18). At the epigenetic level, X-inactivation patterns affecting both coding and non-coding regions may cause a female individual to face both a large gene dosage and sex-specific effects (19), which could disproportionately increase female vulnerability to AD. Mean X-chromosome expression has also shown to be associated with neuronal density (20).; ; Estrogen has been shown to potentially reduce amyloid-beta aggregation and improve a variety of neural functions (hippocampal dendritic spine health, cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism, increase choline acetyltransferase activity, etc.) (13). Hence, the sharp decline in estrogen levels during menopause could be a significant contributor. Four estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found to be associated with increased risk of AD (21). Sex hormones, including estrogen, may also be involved in promoting non-amyloidogenic pathways (alpha-secretase pathway) and decreasing amyloid-beta production (22). However, in the 5-year WHIMS study, risk of MCI or AD diagnosis increased by 37% in an estrogen plus progestin treatment cohort (23) and deleterious effects on frontal lobe and hippocampal volumes were observed in women assigned to hormone therapy (24). Estrogen and testosterone replacement therapies have also not benefited AD patients in multicenter controlled trials. Reconciling these paradoxical findings, given all the nuances of hormonal therapy, should be priority for the field.; ; Our current understanding of AD is that its pathogenesis may begin decades before the manifestation of clinical dementia – a stage now termed as preclinical AD. Indeed, in people at risk for familial autosomal dominant AD (carriers of PSEN and APP mutations), silent amyloid-beta changes have been noted some 25 years before predicted onset of clinical disease. Available evidence does not pinpoint any one biological basis for sex differences in Alzheimer’s susceptibility but suggest that gender affects multiple processes in AD including the manifestation of genetic risk, cognitive reserve, cognitive testing performance, brain atrophy rates, and neurotransmitter profiles. However, existing biomarker studies on gender differences in AD have been largely post hoc and exploratory in nature. Further examination of gender effects in longitudinal multicenter studies, such as Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-2 (ADNI-2), Dominant Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), Alzheimer’s Prevention Initiative (API), the Amyloid Lowering Trial in Asymptomatic Individuals (A4 trial), as well as ongoing large population studies (e.g., Baltimore Study of Aging, Framingham Study, Women’s Health Initiative, Rotterdam Study of Aging) could be next steps. If gender differences are confirmed, then current models of the timeline of biomarker evolution in AD should be modified to incorporate timeline curves specific for men versus women. Indeed, gender-stratified clinical treatment trials may be logical if gender-specific pathological differences exist.; ; Over the next 50 years, barring a cure, the share of the burden born by women may rise much faster than it will for men. It is time to set aside old stereotypes, and prioritize gender-specific research in AD.",5,,288,288,Framingham Heart Study; Psychology; Neuroscience; Cognitive vulnerability; Dementia; Atrophy; Centromere separation; Cognitive decline; Alzheimer's disease; Cognitive reserve,amyloid; biomarkers; hippocampus; sex differences; treatment,,,,https://doaj.org/article/58fd85db64d44c1c8a8a1c3c3e9ce7b6 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4290582/ http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fneur.2014.00288/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/82885380 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2014.00288/full https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25628598/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4290582 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82885380.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2014.00288,25628598,10.3389/fneur.2014.00288,2065286189,PMC4290582,0,000-653-172-984-009; 001-017-186-177-557; 002-837-898-000-08X; 011-951-885-628-914; 021-742-907-446-428; 029-908-247-120-788; 031-964-241-380-923; 037-725-818-106-372; 039-464-326-081-463; 041-738-665-569-620; 044-722-691-217-373; 045-215-490-806-884; 049-341-366-383-135; 050-086-735-109-669; 056-226-484-022-12X; 066-758-783-984-185; 068-747-245-822-68X; 073-973-088-884-09X; 087-199-131-510-252; 089-486-058-669-885; 096-621-846-140-82X; 101-280-397-343-678; 101-991-802-178-575; 104-216-952-786-965; 128-297-616-742-953; 140-605-886-621-189,38,true,cc-by,gold

Spanier; Leo Joskowicz; Shay Moshel; David Israeli,"Candecomp/Parafac Decomposition (CPD) has emerged as a framework for modeling N-way arrays (higher-order matrices). CPD is naturally well suited for the analysis of data sets comprised of observations of a function of multiple discrete indices. In this study we evaluate the prospects of using CPD for modeling MRI brain properties (i.e. brain volume and gray-level) for schizophrenia diagnosis. Taking into account that 3D imaging data consists of millions of pixels per patient, the diagnosis of a schizophrenia patient based on pixel analysis constitutes a methodological challenge (e.g. multiple comparison problem). We show that the CPD could potentially be used as a dimensionality redaction method and as a discriminator between schizophrenia patients and match control, using the gradient of pre- and post Gd-T1-weighted MRI data, which is strongly correlated with cerebral blood perfusion. Our approach was tested on 68 MRI scans: 40 first-episode schizophrenia patients and 28 matched controls. The CPD subject’s scores exhibit statistically significant result (P < 0.001). In the context of diagnosing schizophrenia with MRI, the results suggest that the CPD could potentially be used to discriminate between schizophrenia patients and matched control. In addition, the CPD model suggests for brain regions that might exhibit abnormalities in schizophrenia patients for future research.",9413,,797,803,Radiology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Perfusion; Multiple comparisons problem; Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming); Context (language use); Volumetric imaging; Imaging data; Brain size; Medicine,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2081596 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015SPIE.9413E..2YS/abstract https://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2211479 https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/9413/1/Schizophrenia-patients-differentiation-based-on-MR-vascular-perfusion-and-volumetric/10.1117/12.2081596.full https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/miip/miip2015.html#SpanierJMI15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2081596,,10.1117/12.2081596,2091911493,,0,000-051-866-062-174; 009-277-168-214-862; 018-907-837-120-91X; 019-293-042-961-013; 019-848-322-966-86X; 020-394-341-495-452; 027-887-833-618-850; 035-408-710-879-945; 041-354-225-087-713; 042-917-926-681-988; 048-328-308-911-873; 063-235-476-434-51X; 064-885-321-955-987; 071-583-590-743-43X; 071-976-157-796-503; 074-151-322-924-63X; 079-065-051-792-209; 103-276-925-955-549; 141-085-938-163-301; 164-298-765-389-145,0,false,,

This review critically examines the different scenarios of the application of MRI‐based brain volumetry in neurology: 1) supporting disease diagnosis, 2) understanding mechanisms and tracking clinical progression of disease, and 3) monitoring treatment effect.

Alexander,"We demonstrate the use of a probabilistic generative model to explore the biomarker changes occurring as Alzheimer's disease develops and progresses. We enhanced the recently introduced event-based model for use with a multi-modal sporadic disease data set. This allows us to determine the sequence in which Alzheimer's disease biomarkers become abnormal without reliance on a priori clinical diagnostic information or explicit biomarker cut points. The model also characterizes the uncertainty in the ordering and provides a natural patient staging system. Two hundred and eighty-five subjects (92 cognitively normal, 129 mild cognitive impairment, 64 Alzheimer's disease) were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with measurements of 14 Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers including cerebrospinal fluid proteins, regional magnetic resonance imaging brain volume and rates of atrophy measures, and cognitive test scores. We used the event-based model to determine the sequence of biomarker abnormality and its uncertainty in various population subgroups. We used patient stages assigned by the event-based model to discriminate cognitively normal subjects from those with Alzheimer's disease, and predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment. The model predicts that cerebrospinal fluid levels become abnormal first, followed by rates of atrophy, then cognitive test scores, and finally regional brain volumes. In amyloid-positive (cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β1-42 < 192 pg/ml) or APOE-positive (one or more APOE4 alleles) subjects, the model predicts with high confidence that the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers become abnormal in a distinct sequence: amyloid-β1-42, phosphorylated tau, total tau. However, in the broader population total tau and phosphorylated tau are found to be earlier cerebrospinal fluid markers than amyloid-β1-42, albeit with more uncertainty. The model's staging system strongly separates cognitively normal and Alzheimer's disease subjects (maximum classification accuracy of 99%), and predicts conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (maximum balanced accuracy of 77% over 3 years), and from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (maximum balanced accuracy of 76% over 5 years). By fitting Cox proportional hazards models, we find that baseline model stage is a significant risk factor for conversion from both mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (P = 2.06 × 10(-7)) and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (P = 0.033). The data-driven model we describe supports hypothetical models of biomarker ordering in amyloid-positive and APOE-positive subjects, but suggests that biomarker ordering in the wider population may diverge from this sequence. The model provides useful disease staging information across the full spectrum of disease progression, from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. This approach has broad application across neurodegenerative disease, providing insights into disease biology, as well as staging and prognostication.",10,4,172,,Internal medicine; Oncology; Disease; Atrophy; Population; Proportional hazards model; Abnormality; Neuroimaging; Cognitive test; Biomarker (medicine),,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1552526014003082 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/20485989.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2014.04.180,,10.1016/j.jalz.2014.04.180,2092792652,,0,,3,false,,

Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was calculated from tau PET images for 6 composite FreeSurfer-derived regions-of-interests approximating in vivo Braak stage (Braak ROIs). On volumetric MRI analysis, stepwise logistic regression analyses identified the cingulate isthmus and inferior parietal lobule as significant regions in discriminating AD from HC and MCI. The combined model incorporating automated volumes of selected brain regions on MRI (cingulate isthmus, inferior parietal lobule, hippocampus) and SUVRs of Braak ROIs on [18F] THK-5351 PET showed higher performance than SUVRs of Braak ROIs on [18F] THK-5351 PET in discriminating AD from HC (0.98 vs 0.88, P = 0.033) but not in discriminating AD from MCI (0.85 vs 0.79, P = 0.178).

Farías; Andrea González; Matías Estrella; Ricardo B. Maccioni,"The establishment of a molecular biomarker for early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical for diagnosis and follow up of patients, and as a quantitative parameter in the evaluation of potential new drugs to control AD. A list of blood biomarkers has been reported but none has been validated for the Alzheimer's clinic. The changes in hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid peptide in the cerebrospinal fluid is currently used as a tool in the clinics and for research purposes, but this method is highly invasive. Recently, we reported a non-invasive and reliable blood biomarker that correlates the increase in the ratio of heavy tau (HMWtau) and the low molecular weight tau (LMWtau) in human platelets and the decrease in the brain volume as measured by structural MRI. This molecular marker has been named Alz-tau®. Beyond the clinical trials developed with a Latin American population, the present study focuses on an evaluation of this biomarker in a Caucasian population. We examined 36 AD patients and 15 cognitively normal subjects recruited in Barcelona, Spain. Tau levels in platelets were determined by immunoreactivity and the cognitive status by using GDS and MMSE neuropsychological tests.

Here, we examined the association of stage 1 vs. stage 2 with structural brain reserve in memory-related brain regions.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We tested whether the volumes of hippocampal subfields and parahippocampal regions were larger in individuals at stage 1 compared to asymptomatic amyloid-negative older adults (healthy controls, HCs). We also tested whether individuals with stage 2 would show the opposite pattern, namely smaller brain volumes than in amyloid-negative individuals with SCD. Participants with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker data and bilateral volumetric MRI data from the observational, multi-centric DZNE-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE) study were included. The sample comprised 95 amyloid-negative and 26 amyloid-positive asymptomatic participants as well as 104 amyloid-negative and 47 amyloid-positive individuals with SCD. Volumes were based on high-resolution T2-weighted images and automatic segmentation with manual correction according to a recently established high-resolution segmentation protocol.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">In asymptomatic individuals, brain volumes of hippocampal subfields and of the parahippocampal cortex were numerically larger in stage 1 compared to HCs, whereas the opposite was the case in individuals with SCD. MANOVAs with volumes as dependent data and age, sex, years of education, and DELCODE site as covariates showed a significant interaction between diagnosis (asymptomatic versus SCD) and amyloid status (Aß42/40 negative versus positive) for hippocampal subfields. Post hoc paired comparisons taking into account the same covariates showed that dentate gyrus and CA1 volumes in SCD were significantly smaller in amyloid-positive than negative individuals. In contrast, CA1 volumes were significantly (p = 0.014) larger in stage 1 compared with HCs.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">These data indicate that HCs and stages 1 and 2 do not correspond to linear brain volume reduction. Instead, stage 1 is associated with larger than expected volumes of hippocampal subfields in the face of amyloid pathology. This indicates a brain reserve mechanism in stage 1 that enables individuals with amyloid pathologic change to be cognitively normal and asymptomatic without subjective cognitive decline.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2023.

Nineteen normal subjects and nine patients with AD underwent serial three-dimensional MRI (6- to 30-month scan intervals). Repeat studies were registered to the baseline studies. The accuracy of the BBSI was assessed by comparison with simulated atrophy and with segmentation; it was also tested for reproducibility, linearity, and its ability to discriminate patients with AD from healthy controls. The BBSI correlated closely with simulated volumes of atrophy (r = 1.000). The mean absolute difference between repeat measures was 1.51 ml or .13% of mean brain volume. Rates of atrophy from all 18 AD scan pairs were widely separated from those of all 31 control pairs. In matched subgroups, the mean (SD) annual rate of brain atrophy in nine controls was .24% (.32%), compared with 2.78% (.92%) in nine patients with AD.

074-572-155-666-260,Translational potential of human brain charts.,2022-07-20,2022,journal article,Clinical and translational medicine,20011326,Wiley,Germany,Saashi A Bedford; Jakob Seidlitz; Richard A I Bethlehem,"Since the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), researchers have attempted to characterise neuroanatomical alterations and profiles related to myriad human diseases, with the ultimate goal of informing clinical practice. To date, this translational promise has not been fully realised, especially in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders where there are no established pathological indicators.1 This may at least partially be attributable to two factors. First, there are large variations in the tools, methods and analyses used. Second, psychiatric conditions are characteristically heterogeneous in presentation, aetiology and biology. Yet, traditional case–control designs assume group homogeneity. An increasingly popular alternative is normative modelling, which explicitly aims to quantify individual variation relative to a normative pattern. Similar to traditional paediatric growth charts, a deviation in, for example, brain morphology can be represented by a centile score, indicating each participant's position within the range of others of the same age and sex.2 If the aim is clinical translation, it is vital to first establish a reliable and representative standardised reference. Recently, we aimed to provide such a baseline by mapping the developmental trajectories of multiple commonly studied neuroanatomical phenotypes in a sample of over 100 000 individuals across the full lifespan.3 These brain charts present a number of immediate research opportunities to help advance our understanding of a variety of human diseases. First, bringing neuroimaging data into a common space—enabled by harmonisation of large, complex datasets from multiple sources—will allow us to examine group differences at unprecedented scale. This may reveal subtle differences undetectable in smaller datasets, and more broadly fits with the increasing realisation that large sample sizes are pivotal for replicable brain–behaviour relationships.4 Second, (per)centile scores derived from these brain charts also provide an immediate opportunity to closely explore inter-individual variation. For example, we can assess whether more extreme deviations in neuroanatomical scores relate to clinical severity or cognition. Third, centile scoring across neuroanatomical features could enable identification of subgroups that share common patterns of deviation within a clinical classification. For example, in autism there have been findings of both increased and decreased brain volume, which may represent different autistic subtypes. These subgroups may also have significant clinical relevance: having a larger brain has been associated with severe disabilities and poorer prognosis in young autistic boys.5 Finally, this approach gives us the ability to explore transdiagnostic neurodevelopmental and ageing patterns. Despite the known phenotypic, genetic and neuroanatomical overlap often observed between conditions, they are typically studied in isolation and often present in different parts of the lifespan. A standard reference space could help delineate both shared and distinct neurobiological signatures across clinical conditions. Analogous to the use of paediatric growth charts, there is a potential future clinical use case of these brain charts, especially as MRI becomes more affordable and more accessible. Indeed, brain growth charts have already been used in this context.6 Centiles provide a common, clinically interpretable language that we hope will in the future aid early diagnoses and thereby improve prognosis or treatment outcomes in psychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions. Neurodevelopmental conditions, where early brain development may deviate from typical trajectories, could become one such application. For example, there is evidence that neuroanatomical alterations in autistic children can be apparent from as early as 6 months, and predict diagnosis at 24 months with high accuracy,7 highlighting the potential for brain imaging to inform early identification. Given the high heterogeneity in neurodevelopmental conditions and a lack of understanding of underlying biology or causal mechanisms, providing an exact digital diagnosis is an unrealistic goal. However, normative reference charts may provide an instrument for individualised assessment that could lead to early referral, and fit into a broader clinical evaluation of neurodevelopment. Neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia, where MRI is routinely collected, may be another promising target for clinical translation. Neuroanatomical alterations, such as grey matter atrophy, and divergence of neuroanatomical trajectories associated with dementia are relatively well characterised, and have been shown to be present as early as 10–15 years before symptom onset or diagnosis.8 Furthermore, specific neuroanatomical profiles have been linked to variations in Alzheimer's related decline and prognosis.9 The ability to track individuals across longitudinal measurements could enable earlier diagnosis and may even predict outcomes. As centile scores are, under normal conditions, stable over time, changes could be indicative of a risk or prodromal phase for neurodegeneration. Changes in centile scores could also be used to monitor progression of the condition over time, and to flag diagnostic transitions, for example, from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. To conclude, there is still progress to be made before these models can make it into clinical practice. First, progress needs to be made in reconciling neuroanatomical correlates and trajectories of specific conditions, or of subgroups within these conditions. The inherent heterogeneity of these conditions makes this a huge challenge, and may continue to hamper our ability to derive specific predictive clinical information from MRIs despite advances in technology and analysis methods. Another limitation is the lack of accessibility of MRIs, along with challenges of scanning young children or those with neurodevelopmental or psychiatric conditions. Furthermore, despite the large sample size used to derive the current reference, the demographic characteristics mirror known biases in the neuroimaging and general scientific literature, with an overrepresentation of Caucasian, European and North American populations. This limits the generalisability to clinical practice, and future research efforts should endeavour to address this bias, especially in the context of translational research. Finally, there are ethical considerations of consent and data privacy, as well as implications of providing medical advice on currently incurable conditions and the potential for this information to harm rather than help.10 This is especially relevant in cases where no known effective cures or treatments exist. Despite these caveats, normative life-spanning brain charts hold great promise as both a research and clinical tool, and may prove to be an important step towards individualised medicine.",12,7,e960,,Normative; Neuroimaging; Sample size determination; Data science; Medicine; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Computer science; Neuroscience; Statistics; Philosophy; Mathematics; Epistemology,,Brain; Head; Humans,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ctm2.960 https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.960 https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/340310/2/article.pdf https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/340310 https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstreams/ac055583-b101-46d7-8dee-d5309b677291/download https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/339326,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.960,35858047,10.1002/ctm2.960,,PMC9299572,0,004-705-832-740-147; 006-938-889-025-320; 012-038-412-072-684; 021-094-607-968-571; 024-815-374-533-150; 036-259-317-032-131; 039-103-717-475-722; 055-039-578-640-455; 072-070-019-844-736; 074-572-155-666-260; 077-492-222-536-802,8,true,cc-by,gold

Knopp,"Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to assess global and regional cerebral volumes in patients with a clinical diagnosis of subcortical vascular dementia (VD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whole brain volume, cerebrospinal fluid volume, volumes of the temporal, frontal and parietal lobes, the cerebellum and the amygdala-hippocampus complex were determined using a personal computer-based software. Seventeen patients with VD, 22 patients with AD and 13 healthy controls were included. Analysis of covariance using age as covariate demonstrated significant mean differences between controls and dementia groups with respect to all morphological parameters. However, apart from the volume of the cerebellum no significant volumetric differences were found between VD and AD. These results indicate that MRI-based volumetry allows differentiation between AD or VD from normal controls and that measurement of cerebellar volume may be of use to separate vascular and degenerative dementia. However, since the distribution of cerebral atrophy in both dementia groups is very similar, it is suggested that the atrophic changes are not specific to the underlying cause but rather reflect the selective vulnerability of neuronal structures.",9,6,309,316,Pathology; Psychology; Degenerative disease; Vascular dementia; Central nervous system disease; Dementia; Cerebral atrophy; Personal computer; Alzheimer's disease; Brain size,,"Aged; Alzheimer Disease/pathology; Brain/pathology; Dementia, Vascular/pathology; Female; Humans; Male",,,https://tud.qucosa.de/id/qucosa%3A27682 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/9769443 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9769443/ https://tud.qucosa.de/api/qucosa%3A27682/attachment/ATT-0/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9769443,http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000017082,9769443,10.1159/000017082,2049275592,,0,004-218-657-761-38X; 004-454-698-486-913; 007-191-004-861-510; 008-918-538-911-296; 009-284-246-138-144; 009-773-242-304-237; 010-475-681-567-67X; 010-976-551-051-339; 015-221-577-721-093; 017-801-001-563-516; 017-841-879-355-156; 018-684-819-202-502; 019-743-140-704-059; 022-988-712-445-94X; 025-140-248-915-469; 025-572-822-783-464; 029-319-902-294-683; 030-155-573-452-907; 031-109-210-228-569; 034-089-069-610-315; 043-664-842-061-021; 044-437-386-524-34X; 044-707-402-422-00X; 045-933-195-284-821; 046-705-178-227-130; 048-536-112-681-339; 060-264-114-573-532; 070-867-545-420-584; 072-222-090-991-341; 075-181-514-867-792; 076-183-403-202-494; 076-914-857-674-505; 077-063-935-967-586; 082-687-287-203-196; 088-547-988-244-277; 091-381-517-812-283; 102-503-990-404-525; 103-141-512-328-362; 110-190-021-928-771; 116-160-767-556-071; 124-318-041-035-477; 125-265-134-404-518; 125-700-883-079-541; 131-529-601-049-118; 131-756-174-644-245; 133-033-723-369-156; 142-217-901-479-511,61,true,,green

Novel methods, such as Statistical Parametrical Mapping, provide an automated means of comparing structural features across high quality MRI scans and the measurement based on the principles of voxel based morphometry. For the purposes of the present study, we selected sex balanced group of young adults with recent onset illness to assess the effects of the illness on the volumes of compartments and also to minimize the effects of chronicity, medication, sex and aging. Sixty-four subjects were selected from a larger sample (inclusion criteria: age range 18-31). Thirty-one had DSM IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 33 were controls. T1 weighted MRI images were acquired on two scanners (1.5T both): a) fast gradient echo sequence, FLASH, 40 msec repetition time, 5 ms echo time, 40 degree flip angle and b) turbo gradient echo, 12 msec repetition time, 4 msec echo time, 20 degree flip angle, 1 excitation). The resulting data set consisted of: a) 128 consecutive slices with 1.17 mm thickness and 256 x 256 pixels per slice and b) 160 consecutive slices of 1 mm thickness and 256 x 256 pixels per slice. All 64 images were processed by ANALZYE, and normalized and segmented by SPM99. Following the automatic segmentation of the images into the three intracranial compartments, volumetry was performed based on the principles of voxel analysis. Results were expressed relative to whole brain volume, and MANOVA analyses were performed to correct the confounding effects of MRI acquisition center differences and age difference between diagnostic groups. Young adults with recent onset schizophrenia had 6% reduction in GM volume and 14% increase in the volume of CSF, after all confounders were included into analyses (MANCOVA: p = 0.006 and 0.0002, respectively). No significant changes in WM volume were evident. In comparison to a few similar studies published recently, all results yielded similar scores regarding effects of recent onset illness and young adult population, thus confirming the reliability of the procedure. In conclusion, global neuropil reduction was discussed as a consequence of the cortical neurodevelopmental disgenesis.

Murray,"Background and Aims:Neurocognitive and functional neuroimaging studies point to frontal lobe abnormalities in schizophrenia. Molecular and behavioural genetic studies suggest that the frontal lobe is under significant genetic influence. We carried out structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the frontal lobe in monozygotic (MZ) twins concordant or discordant for schizophrenia and healthy MZ control twins.Methods:The sample comprised 21 concordant pairs, 17 discordant affected and 18 discordant unaffected twins from 19 discordant pairs, and 27 control pairs. Groups were matched on sociodemographic variables. Patient groups (concordant, discordant affected) did not differ on clinical variables. Volumes of superior, middle, inferior and orbital frontal gyri were calculated using the Cavalieri principle on the basis of manual tracing of anatomic boundaries. Group differences were investigated covarying for whole-brain volume, gender and age.Results:Results for superior frontal gyrus showed that twins with schizophrenia (i.e. concordant twins and discordant affected twins) had reduced volume compared to twins without schizophrenia (i.e. discordant unaffected and control twins), indicating an effect of illness. For middle and orbital frontal gyrus, concordant (but not discordant affected) twins differed from non-schizophrenic twins. There were no group differences in inferior frontal gyrus volume.Conclusions:These findings suggest that volume reductions in the superior frontal gyrus are associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (in the presence or absence of a co-twin with schizophrenia). On the other hand, volume reductions in middle and orbital frontal gyri are seen only in concordant pairs, perhaps reflecting the increased genetic vulnerability in this group.",23,,S144,,Concordance; Superior frontal gyrus; Frontal lobe; Diagnosis of schizophrenia; Inferior frontal gyrus; Frontal gyrus; Functional neuroimaging; Audiology; Medicine; Schizophrenia,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/29864690 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924933808005129 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-psychiatry/article/abs/p0216-magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-frontal-lobe-in-twins-with-schizophrenia/32E76BD3F3C1E646D1E96E387079BED5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpsy.2008.01.883,,10.1016/j.eurpsy.2008.01.883,2077752392,,0,,0,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-SA, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in noncoding region of C9ORF72 causes chromosome 9p-linked FTD and ALS. Neuron 72(2), 245–256 (2011); Renton AE, Majounie E, Waite A et al. A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the cause of chromosome 9p21-linked ALS–FTD. Neuron 72(2), 257–268 (2011).Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the third most common neurodegenerative disease in the western world, is a fatal disease that presents clinically with characteristic progressive paralysis before death from respiratory failure, typically within 2–3 years of symptom onset. Approximately 5% of cases are familial, with the majority of cases apparently occuring randomly throughout the population. There is growing consensus, based on clinical, genetic and epidemiological data, that ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are in some cases variants of a clinicopathological spectrum of disease, characterized by the presence of TDP-43-positive inclusions throughout the CNS.A number of genes have been implicated in classical familial ALS, but they cumulatively account for only approximately 25% of familial cases, raising the possibility of other unidentified causative genes. However, several recent genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses have confirmed an association of a chromosome 9p21 locus with ALS and FTD. In particular, a founder haplotype, including the MOBKL2B, IFNK and C9ORF72 genes, is present in the majority of cases linked to this region.In these two large-scale collaborative, complementary studies, the investigators utilized repeat-primed PCR to identify an expansion of a noncoding hexanucleotide repeat (GGGGCC) in the gene C9ORF72 on the affected haplotype that is strongly associated with ALS–FTD. DeJesus Hernandez et al. identified this repeat expansion in the majority of families in their study with a combined FTD–ALS phenotype and TDP-43-based pathology. By analyzing extended clinical series, they found the C9ORF72 repeat expansion to be the most frequent genetic abnormality in both familial FTD (11.7%) and familial ALS (22.5%). Remarkably, Renton et al. found that the repeat expansion accounted for nearly half of all familial ALS–FTD cases in Finland and more than a third of familial ALS cases in other European populations. In conjunction with the D90A SOD1 mutation, 87% of familial ALS cases in Finland are now explained by a simple monogenic etiology. The repeat expansion was also found to be present in a third of familial ALS cases of outbred European descent.The findings put FTD–ALS into the growing class of noncoding repeat expansion disorders, including myotonic dystrophies and spinocerebellar ataxias. The repeat expansion itself leads to the loss of one alternatively spliced C9ORF72 transcript and to the formation of nuclear RNA foci, suggesting multiple disease mechanisms, but providing further evidence in favor of disrupted RNA metabolism as a cause of neurodegeneration. Overall, the GGGGCC expansion underlies an unprecedented proportion of ALS cases in Finland and familial ALS cases of European ancestry, and is the most common genetic cause of these diseases identified thus far. The authors suggest that future molecular studies are required to further characterize the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and pathological TDP-43 aggregation, in addition to larger-scale evaluations of patients with FTD and ALS associated with the expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat to delineate the range of phenotypes and prevalence of these disorders. Finally, the authors propose that this genetic defect be referred to in future as 'c9FTD/ALS'– Written by Peter Livermore. Article suggested by Ammar Al-ChalabiDeng HX, Chen W, Hong ST et al. Mutations in UBQLN2 cause dominant X-linked juvenile and adult-onset ALS and ALS/dementia. Nature 477(7363), 211–215 (2011).Dementia, primarily of the frontotemporal lobar type, can occur in some ALS cases, yet it is not clear whether ALS and dementia occurring separately share a common etiology and stem from the same pathogenic processes in ALS–dementia.Furthering the quest to shed light on the etiology of ALS, Deng and colleagues studied five generations of a family with ALS, including 19 affected individuals, and initially established linkage of the disease with several microsatellite markers on the X chromosome. Detailed mapping enabled the investigators to narrow down a minimum candidate region in which the causative gene was located. Sequencing of 41 genes revealed that a unique mutation in UBQLN2, which encodes the ubiquitin-like protein UBQLN2, involved in regulating the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, was the causative agent. By screening 188 probands from other families without male-to-male transmission, the authors subsequently identified four other mutations in this gene that were causative for ALS and ALS–dementia and, notably, all involved proline residues in a unique PXX repeat region of the gene. Further investigation revealed novel ubiquilin2 pathology in the spinal cords of ALS patients and in the brains of ALS–dementia cases, regardless of the presence of UBQLN2 mutations. Functional analysis indicated that the UBQLN2 mutations lead to aberrant protein degradation.Overall, the findings provide a link between impaired proteasome function and neurodegeneration, implicating a common pathogenic mechanism that may be targeted for the development of therapeutic approaches.– Written by Peter Livermore.

Disord. 26(12), 2183–2189 (2011).In Parkinson's disease (PD), it is well established that nigrostriatal dopaminergic lesions contribute to motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia, whereas axial symptoms are more related to extrastriatal and nondopaminergic pathologies. By contrast, although a variety of cognitive domains are impaired in PD, with important clinical consequences for patients, caregivers and health-related costs, little is yet known regarding the underlying pathologies, with the exception of fronto-subcortical dopamine depletion contributing to executive dysfunction. In particular, little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms of the early cognitive impairments. In addition to biomarker research, exploring the association between various cognitive dysfunctions and specific motor symptoms may shed light on the pathophysiology of cognitive deficits.This study is from the New Parkinsonism in Umeå project (NYPUM) in Umeå, Sweden, one of the best-designed prospective studies of cognition in PD. The researchers included an incidence cohort of PD in a defined geographical region and explored cognitive functioning with a comprehensive battery of tests before starting any dopaminergic medication. In this report, based on 103 patients, associations between specific cognitive and motor dysfunctions were analyzed. It was found that, whereas executive dysfunction was associated with bradykinesia, postural instability and gait disturbances were associated with visuospatial and visual memory disturbances. The authors propose a dopaminergic network responsible for slow movements and inflexible thinking, which might be different from the dopaminergic network subserving tremor and rigidity. By contrast, postural instability and gait disturbances, together with memory and visuospatial impairments, may be related to nondopaminergic circuits such as cholinergic systems. Strengths of this study include the population-based sample of de novo PD and the diagnosis being substantiated using dopamine transporter imaging. The findings shed new light on the underlying mechanisms of motor and cognitive symptoms in PD, with potential treatment implications. It will be interesting to test these hypotheses with structural and functional imaging studies.– Written by Dag AarslandTabrizi SJ, Reilmann R, Roos RA et al.; the TRACK-HD investigators. Potential endpoints for clinical trials in premanifest and early Huntington's disease in the TRACK-HD study: analysis of 24 month observational data. Lancet Neurol. 11(1), 42–53 (2012).The test for the gene that causes Huntington's disease (HD) is well established and readily available, but its presence does not confer any information about disease status or disease progression. Gauging this currently relies on longitudinal clinical assessments, which are inherently variable and unreliable, and a confident diagnosis may require follow-up over several years. This problem is magnified in trials of new treatments in individuals who have not yet developed the full-blown condition (premanifest) or are in the early stages of the condition, where there is a pressure to complete a trial with manageable numbers of patients in a reasonably short time frame.TRACK-HD, a multicenter study that commenced in 2008, followed 117 gene-positive premanifest, 116 early manifest and 116 control individuals annually over a 2-year period to search for biomarkers of disease onset and progression. A variety of objective assessment tools were used in an attempt to measure changes across a wide range of symptoms in HD, namely movement (including eye movement), cognition, behavior, MRI and wet biomarkers. The most sensitive assessment modality appears to have been loss of brain volume, although there were detectable changes in a number of the movement and cognitive tasks and some of the behavioral assessments (such as motivation) that may have potential as outcome measures. Change was more readily detectable in the early manifest, compared with the premanifest, group although measurable volumetric MRI changes were found in the premanifest patients as they approached disease onset (within 10 years). It is interesting that there was a discrepancy between the clinical status of the premanifest participants and the scan changes, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms act to maintain good function over this period and thus 'disease onset' may reflect a breakdown of these processes. The changes reported in this study still need to be validated as clinical tools and, in particular, their sensitivity to therapeutic agents has not yet been explored. However, this work opens the way for the development of substantially improved assessment tools, which will make clinical trials in early HD possible and which may also provide additional clues to the molecular pathogenesis of this condition.– Written by Anne RosserFinancial & competing interests disclosureThe authors have no relevant affiliations or financial involvement with any organization or entity with a financial interest in or financial conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript.

Nevertheless, there has recently been a growing interest about the potential therapeutic value of cannabis in several medical conditions. 1 – 4 Beneficial effects of cannabis in multiple sclerosis have focused much of the attention of scientists in the past few years. 2 , 4 Illegal self-medication with cannabis both in smoked and in oral forms has, however, been reported for years. 5 Anecdotal reports suggest that cannabis can relieve not only muscle spasticity and pain but, in some cases, can also improve bladder control. Many randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials have attempted to investigate the potential efficacy of various cannabinoid treatments in managing spasticity, pain, bladder problems, sleep disturbances, and tremor due to multiple sclerosis. 4 , 6 – 16 Results of clinical trials have been mixed, but together with insights from basic research and animal models of multiple sclerosis, they provide reasonable evidence for the potential therapeutic use of cannabinoids in the treatment of multiple sclerosis related symptoms. 1 , 17 Findings of biological experiments have also revealed the possible immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties of cannabinoids, 4 , 18 , 19 thus further supporting their potential utility in multiple sclerosis therapeutics. However, many issues still remain unresolved. 20 Accordingly, synthetic cannabis-based preparations [dronabinol (Marinol®), nabilone (Cesamet®), Δ 9 –tetrahydrocannabinol + cannabidiol (Sativex®)] have been used in the U.S., Canada and some other countries as an authorized treatment for nausea and vomiting in cancer chemotherapy, appetite loss in AIDS wasting syndromes and symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis. 3 , 21 Recent research developments regarding the therapeutic use of cannabis analogues in several medical conditions and the concurrent possibility that cannabis might be fully legalized for patients with severe and chronic medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis provided the motive for this article. If cannabis products were to be used legally in the future for therapeutic purposes, this would naturally raise the concern of possible adverse effects associated with long-term use and especially with respect to the central nervous system (CNS) and cognition. It has been suggested that these effects may be greater in vulnerable groups such as patients suffering from diseases of the CNS. Non-acute cognitive dysfunction resulting from accumulative cannabis exposure has been a matter of investigation mainly with recreational cannabis users. 22 – 24 Psychiatric effects of long-term exposure to cannabis, such as comorbid depression and predisposal to psychosis, are issues that have also been reported in the literature. 25 – 27 Nevertheless, the focus of this article is the potential adverse effects of long-term exposure to cannabis-based medicinal extracts on cognition. The article provides a review of the current literature on this issue and critically considers the potential that cognitive deficits attributed to long-term heavy recreational exposure might be extended to controlled pharmaceutical use in multiple sclerosis patients. We performed a search of the PubMed database for articles dated from 1986 to March 2007 in order to locate studies of cannabinoid use in multiple sclerosis, cannabis and cognitive dysfunction, long-term effects of exposure to cannabis on cognition, and neuropsychological/neuropsychiatric aspects of multiple sclerosis. Key words used in the search strategy were: “multiple sclerosis,” “cannabinoids,” “cognition,” combined with the terms cannabis-based medicinal extracts, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), marijuana, neuropsychology and neuropsychiatry. These searches were limited to English-language articles and augmented by bibliographical searches of the obtained references. Further, we hand searched the following journals dated from 2003 to March 2007: Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology, Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, Neurology, and The Clinical Neuropsychologist . We included only relevant articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Neurobiology and Pharmacology of Cannabis and the Endocannabinoid System The main psychoactive component of cannabis is Δ 9 –tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ 9 –THC). The drug is most commonly delivered by smoking a plant-derived cigarette. Acute effects of cannabis have been well recognized, including euphoria and relaxation, intoxication, short-term memory impairment, disruption of psychomotor control, poor executive functions, distorted sense of time, increased appetite, and analgesia. 3 Acute panic, paranoia, and psychosis have been reported in some subjects. 26 , 28 Although some researchers claim that marijuana is not particularly addictive, there is evidence that heavy and chronic users are likely to develop tolerance and dependence on the drug. 3 , 29 – 30 On the basis of current research, cannabis does not appear to induce a clear withdrawal syndrome, as do other drugs of abuse, such as opiates. 31 However, there is no doubt that individuals suffer unpleasant effects when abstaining from chronic cannabis use. 31 Thus, although addictive behaviors such as compulsive drug seeking due to craving are rarely induced by marijuana use, preparations containing higher Δ 9 –THC concentrations, such as hashish, have been shown to induce addictive behaviors, especially in populations at risk. 32 Furthermore, some users develop problems related to the drug, and many request professional assistance in limiting their consumption. 33 Indeed, cannabis dependence is a DSM-IV diagnostic category. However, it has been proposed that dependence on cannabis should deal only with psychological dependence. 34 Whether a certain individual will eventually succumb to the addictive potential of cannabis will obviously be the outcome of a combination of factors. Thus, it has been suggested that the dependence syndrome on cannabis via international classification systems (e.g., DSM-IV) should be revised. 34 Recent investigations have shed light on the mechanisms of the pharmacological actions of Δ 9 –THC and other chemically related molecules known as cannabinoids. Exogenous cannabinoids include phytocannabinoids such as Δ 9 –THC, cannabinol, cannabidiol, and other cannabinoid compounds present in extracts of the plant Cannabis sativa , as well as synthetic cannabinoids produced in the laboratory. Two endogenous cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) have been identified 35 , 36 although additional cannabinoid receptors may exist but have not yet been cloned. 37 Furthermore, endogenous ligands for these receptors have been isolated. These endogenous cannabinoids comprise a series of arachidonic acid derivatives such as anandamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), 2-arachidonoylglycerol ether, virodhamine and N -arachidonoyldopamine which are referred to as “endocannabinoids” (for a review, see Mechoulam et al.). 38 Δ 9 –THC and other synthetic analogues exert their effects by acting as agonists at the cannabinoids (CB1 and CB2) receptors. However, some of the other constituents of cannabis, such as cannabidiol, which have well-documented biological effects of potential therapeutic interest, such as antianxiety and anticonvulsive properties, do not significantly interact with CB1 or CB2 receptors. This fact possibly explains the reason why cannabidiol does not possess psychotropic actions. Its effects have been largely attributed to inhibition of anandamide degradation or its antioxidant properties. 39 CB1 receptors are thoroughly expressed in the CNS, most densely in the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, hypothalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus, and are localized to axons and nerve terminals while being absent from the neuronal soma and dendrites. 3 In consistency with their presynaptic localization, the activation of CB1 receptors is thought to modify synaptic function by inhibiting the release of various neurotransmitters (L-glutamate, GABA, dopamine, 5-HT, and acetylcholine). 40 CB2 receptors, in contrast, are mostly found in peripheral tissues, predominantly in the immune system. 3 Interestingly, very recent evidence suggests that the CB2 receptors are expressed in the mammalian brain and may influence behavior. 41 The endocannabinoid system controls signaling processes between neurons in a retrograde manner. Endocannabinoids are not stored but are rapidly generated by postsynaptic neurons in response to Ca 2+ influx resulting from depolarization induced opening of voltage-controlled Ca 2+ channels. 42 When endocannabinoids are released from the postsynaptic membrane, they act backward across the synapse, tonically activating presynaptic CB1 receptors to decrease release of either inhibitory or excitatory transmitters. 40 Following an assumed cellular uptake mechanism, endocannabinoids are then degraded by intracellular enzymes. Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and a monoacylglycerol (MAG) lipase are the enzymes proposed to catalyze the hydrolysis of endocannabinoids. 4 Endocannabinoids have been implicated in a variety of physiological functions. These areas of central activity include pain reduction, motor regulation, learning/memory, and emotion. Interestingly, recent evidence has emerged that tissue concentration of endocannabinoids and/or cannabinoid receptor density-activity changes (increasing or decreasing depending on the specific disease or pathological state) in a range of disorders. 43The Neuroprotective Role of Cannabinoids Endocannabinoids might serve several functions in the brain. Of great interest is the potential neuroprotective role in the CNS. Experimental data indicate that endocannabinoids are released and accumulated in response to many different types of toxic insult, such as excitotoxicity, excitotoxic stress, traumatic injury and ischemia possibly representing a compensatory repair mechanism. 44 – 47 The excitotoxicity hypothesis is used to explain the common biochemical basis behind many acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders, including stroke, brain injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. 48 , 49 Thus, the cannabinoid system can serve to protect the brain against excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration and may play a primary role in limiting brain damage. Researchers’ current hypothesis of how cannabinoids provide their protective effects is perhaps that their general dampening of neural activity reduces excitotoxicity. 50 Cannabinergic activity through CB1 receptors is linked to signaling pathways that are protective against pathogenic insults and promote cell survival and maintenance. Such pathways include the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Activation of CB1 receptors has been shown to block presynaptic release of glutamate. 51 Interestingly, endocannabinoid levels were increased in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, 52 although in a more recent study brain concentrations of endocannabinoids were not raised despite the cell damage induced by experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. 53 The disruption of the neuroprotective effect of endocannabinoids was more pronounced in purinergic P2×7 receptor knockout mice after induction of EAE. The authors showed that in this mouse model of multiple sclerosis the limited production of endocannabinoids could be attributed to an interferon gamma-mediated disruption of the function of P2×7 receptors, the activation of which leads to increased production of endocannabinoids by microglia. Collectively, these results strengthen the concept that the endogenous cannabinoid system may serve to establish a defense system for the brain. This system may be functional in several neurodegenerative disorders as well as in acute neuronal damage. Residual Neurocognitive Effects of Cannabis Use Although the acute effects of cannabis use have been well established, the question of whether chronic cannabis use causes residual neurocognitive deficits has produced conflicting data. Despite intensive research efforts in this regard, the literature remains divided and controversial, as no hard findings or consistent results have emerged. The cognitive deficits observed in chronic cannabis users may be temporary and reversible after a period of abstinence (attributable to late intoxication or withdrawal effects) or permanent (due to neurotoxicity). This question apart from its theoretical interest also harbors practical considerations regarding former drug user’s functional capacity after cessation of cannabis use. Even subtle cognitive impairments may prove a serious impediment especially for people whose occupation calls for intact agility and creative thinking. As far as current users are concerned, it is important to examine whether and how cognition is afflicted within unintoxicated intervals, in order to realistically assess functional operations in activities of daily living. Furthermore, it is essential to determine which variables of cannabis consumption (dosage, frequency, duration, or age at onset) independently correlate with cognitive deficits in cannabis users. The drug delivery is perhaps a critical parameter as well, since speculated neurotoxicity of cannabis may be dependent on the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug entering the organism. The smoked route is subject to wide variation. 54 Orally or sublingually delivered cannabis used in modern clinical trials may not provide standard dose absorption; however, the concentration curve of the drug is not as sharp as with smoked cannabis. 54 Intravenous administration retains control of dose but requires strict laboratory conditions. 54 Evidence of cognitive impairment in chronic cannabis users is available in the literature, mainly concerning memory, attention, and executive functions, but it is not clear how long such impairments persist after cannabis use is terminated or whether these deficits are accompanied by drug-induced neuropathology. Studies of nonacute effects of cannabis on brain function require a period of abstinence to eliminate the acute pharmacological actions of the drug. 55 Another general issue affecting most studies on the nonacute effects of cannabis exposure is that the premorbid neurocognitive abilities of these participants are largely unknown; some of the cognitive deficits noted possibly reflect preexisting cognitive impairments rather than consequences of cannabis exposure. 22 , 24 , 55 Potential neurocognitive effects of cannabis withdrawal syndrome might also need to be considered. 29 Pope et al. reported cognitive deficits in current heavy cannabis users after at least 7 days of abstinence. These, however, did not persist after 28 days of drug cessation and were related to recent, not cumulative, drug use. 55 On the contrary, Bolla et al. reported a dose-related effect of cannabis use on neurocognitive performance even after 28 days of abstinence. 56 Moreover, Solowij et al. have demonstrated cognitive impairments in long- versus short-term cannabis users after a median 17-hour abstinence period, indicating an important influence of duration of cannabis consumption on cognitive measures, predominantly verbal learning and memory. 57 In line with previous reports demonstrating cognitive impairment of long-term cannabis users in the unintoxicated state, Messinis et al. recently reported neuropsychological deficits in long-term heavy cannabis users after at least 24 hours (range=36 to 240) of abstinence, indicating duration, frequency, and possibly dosage of cannabis administration as determinants of this effect. 23 In the Messinis et al. study, verbal learning was the cognitive domain most substantially affected by chronic heavy cannabis use, followed by psychomotor speed, attention, and executive functioning. 23 Prior to this study, a meta-analysis of a small number of select studies on the long-term residual neurocognitive effects of cannabis use concluded that among various cognitive domains, impaired learning and retrieval of information were the only cognitive domains to demonstrate a significant effect size. 22 , 24 See Table 1 for a summary of recent studies evaluating the effects of cannabis use on neuropsychological functions. Therefore, deficits in verbal learning and memory tasks in long-term heavy cannabis users have variously been attributed to duration, 23 , 57 frequency of cannabis use, 23 , 55 or cumulative dosage effects. 56 The most pronounced evidence of impaired learning are effects on recall after interference or delay, flatter learning curves, fewer words recalled on each learning trial, and poorer recognition performance. 24TABLE 1. Summary of Recent Studies Providing Evidence for Neuropsychological Deficits in Cannabis UsersTABLE 1. Summary of Recent Studies Providing Evidence for Neuropsychological Deficits in Cannabis UsersEnlarge table The age of the cannabis users participating in neuropsychological studies also appears to influence their verbal learning abilities. More specifically, Fletcher et al. reported that only older (≥45 years) cannabis users differed from control subjects in list learning abilities, whereas users younger than 28 years remained unaffected. 58 Age at onset of cannabis use also seems to influence the occurrence of cognitive impairment, possibly attributable to a neurotoxic effect of cannabis on the developing brain. 59 Pope et al. recently reported that early onset of cannabis use (before the age of 17) is associated with poorer verbal IQ, even after adequate abstinence periods. 60 One important caveat in interpreting these results is that different behavioral trends of adolescents who use cannabis could account for these observations. In addition, visual search was found to be disturbed in early onset, long-term cannabis users. 61 The latency of auditory-evoked potentials has been reported to be significantly longer in cannabis users, especially in early onset users compared to healthy control subjects. In further investigating this issue, brain imaging studies report that adolescents who begin cannabis use before the age of 17 exhibit brain morphological changes, such as smaller brain volume, less cortical gray matter, increased cortical white matter, and increased cerebral blood flow, compared with late-onset users. 62 Increasing evidence further suggests that cannabis-based medicinal extracts may have toxic effects on the fetal nervous system. 19 Macleod et al., 63 in a systematic review of the psychological and social sequelae of cannabis and other illicit drug use by young people, reported that available data do not support a causal relationship between cannabis use by young people and psychosocial harm, but cannot exclude the possibility of such a relationship existing. There is laboratory evidence in support of neurotoxicity of THC. Results of both animal studies and in vitro cell experiments, however, have provided conflicting results. 3 , 44 Chronic heavy cannabis use is not associated with structural changes within the brain as a whole or the hippocampus in particular, 64 so functional alterations might rather account for the observed neurocognitive effects. Clinical neurophysiological studies have further contributed toward investigating this issue. Regular use of cannabis was associated with abnormalities in the P300 wave of event-related potentials during an auditory discrimination task 65 and electroencephalographic abnormalities in another study. 66 Neuroimaging studies have also provided results indicative of persistent effects of cannabis on brain functions. Block et al. 67 and Matochik et al. 68 observed structural alterations in the brain tissue of frequent and heavy users, respectively, while Wilson et al. 62 reported brain morphological and functional changes in early onset cannabis users. Using positron emission tomography (PET), Block et al. 69 detected altered memory-related regional blood flow in the brain of frequent marijuana users after a minimum 26 hours of abstinence. Two other PET studies revealed altered patterns of brain activity in abstinent heavy cannabis users while performing tasks depending on executive functioning either in lack 70 or in presence 71 of performance differences. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study showed increased and more widespread brain activation in heavy cannabis users compared to controls while performing a spatial working memory task. 72 Two additional fMRI studies have demonstrated alterations in brain activity in heavy cannabis users during working memory assessments. 73 , 74 Recently reported preliminary data from an fMRI study of verbal learning and memory in long-term cannabis users found altered activation of the frontal, medial, parietal, and cerebellar regions during the encoding and retrieval processes of words learned from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. 24 , 75Cannabis users seem to exhibit compensatory shifts and recruitment of additional brain regions to meet the demands of various cognitive tasks. These findings could mean that long-term heavy cannabis consumption causes neurophysiological deficits, even in the case of minimally impaired or even normal superficial performance on neuropsychological tests. The subtle cannabis-induced changes in brain function may, therefore, have a huge impact on behavioral and cognitive measures in multiple sclerosis patients, in whom cognitive reserve is assumedly limited and compensatory mechanisms insufficient, as will be discussed below.Cognition in Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis is a multifocal demyelinating disease of the CNS, in which neuroinflammatory as well as degenerative processes are involved. 76 It is the most common cause of nontraumatic neurological disability in young adults and has a major negative impact on quality of life indices. 76 Cognitive impairment is considered one of the clinical markers of the disease. 77 Neuropsychological deficits of varying degree are present in almost 50% of multiple sclerosis patients, interfering with occupational and social functioning even in the absence of significant physical disability. 77 , 78 Cognitive deficits in patients show no strong association to disease characteristics, such as disease duration, physical disability, disease subtype, or disease severity (lesion load in structural magnetic resonance imaging), with studies providing discrepant results. 77 No general consensus exists on the prevalence and special characteristics of cognitive dysfunction in multiple sclerosis, possibly reflecting disease heterogeneity and demyelination of different areas of the CNS. A review of the neuropsychological literature of multiple sclerosis using an effect size analysis, which gathered neuropsychological test results from a total of 1,845 multiple sclerosis patients and 1,265 healthy controls, confirmed that neurocognitive impairments are indeed evident in patients with multiple sclerosis on a number of cognitive measures. 79 This review also reported that chronic progressive multiple sclerosis patients display maximal deficits on frontal-executive tasks, whereas patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis present impairments predominantly on tasks of memory function. 79 Although the pattern of cognitive deficits identified in multiple sclerosis is not uniform, the domains most essentially affected are information processing speed and verbal memory. 77 , 80 , 81 A recent review of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis confirmed that measures of information processing speed appeared to be the most robust and sensitive markers of this impairment, and that single, predominantly speed-related cognitive measures may be superior to extensive and time-consuming test batteries in detecting cognitive decline. 82 Cognitive flexibility and executive functions, such as planning, have also been reported to be deficient. 77 A recent meta-analysis indicated that phonemic and semantic fluency, measures of executive functions, were among the most sensitive neuropsychological tests to detect cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis patients. 83 In a large series of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients, information processing speed was the cognitive domain most frequently impaired, followed by memory. 81 On neuropsychological testing of early phase relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients, information processing speed and memory task performances were impaired. 84 Deficits in the tasks of attention and information processing occurring early in the disease course have been attributed to working memory impairment and may, at least in part, account for subsequent decline in memory—mainly retrieval of information and conceptual reasoning. 85 Working memory deficits occurring early in multiple sclerosis were evident in two studies. 86 , 87 Working memory is dependent on a network of functionally interconnected brain regions, which subtends rehearsal loops handling information load, that exceeds short-term memory storage capacity. 88 , 89 Cognitive dysfunction in multiple sclerosis may result from an interruption of these loops, possibly due to white matter lesions. Compensatory mechanisms operate within the network of regions involved. Reserved brain regions may be recruited as a consequence of an adaptive response to neuronal dysfunction in one region in order to meet the demands of a cognitive task. Cognitive measures are not strongly and consistently correlated to structural damage (lesion load or brain atrophy) in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 77 , 90 More advanced MRI methods, such as magnetization transfer ratio or diffusion tensor imaging, capable of detecting subtle abnormalities in the normal-appearing white matter have been used, and the findings were shown to better correlate with cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis patients. 91 , 92 Explaining cognitive deficits in multiple sclerosis using multiple disconnections has recently focused interest.

Montine; Dedra Buchwald,"BACKGROUND Estimates of hippocampal volume by magnetic resonance imaging have clinical and cognitive correlations and can assist in early Alzheimer disease diagnosis. However, little is known about the relationship between global or regional brain volumes and cognitive test performance in American Indians. MATERIALS AND METHODS American Indian participants (N=698; median age, 72 y) recruited for the Cerebrovascular Disease and its Consequences in American Indians study, an ancillary study of the Strong Heart Study cohort, were enrolled. Linear regression models assessed the relationship between magnetic resonance imaging brain volumes (total brain and hippocampi) and cognitive measures of verbal learning and recall, processing speed, verbal fluency, and global cognition. RESULTS After controlling for demographic and clinical factors, all volumetric measurements were positively associated with processing speed. Total brain volume was also positively associated with verbal learning, but not with verbal recall. Conversely, left hippocampal volume was associated with both verbal learning and recall. The relationship between hippocampal volume and recall performance was more pronounced among those with lower scores on a global cognitive measure. Controlling for APOE e4 did not substantively affect the associations.

083-309-025-362-646,Current Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease: From CSF to Blood.,2020-08-12,2020,journal article,Journal of personalized medicine,20754426,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Kun Zou; Mohammad Abdullah; Makoto Michikawa,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and affects a large portion of the elderly population worldwide. Currently, a diagnosis of AD depends on the clinical symptoms of dementia, magnetic resonance imaging to determine brain volume, and positron emission tomography imaging to detect brain amyloid or tau deposition. The best characterized biological fluid markers for AD are decreased levels of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) 42 and increased levels of phosphorylated tau and total tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, less invasive and easily detectable biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD, especially at the early stage, are still under development. Here, we provide an overview of various biomarkers identified in CSF and blood for the diagnostics of AD over the last 25 years. CSF biomarkers that reflect the three hallmarks of AD, amyloid deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration, are well established. Based on the need to start treatment in asymptomatic people with AD and to screen for AD risk in large numbers of young, healthy individuals, the development of biomarkers for AD is shifting from CSF to blood. Elements of the core pathogenesis of AD in blood, including Aβ42, tau proteins, plasma proteins, or lipids have shown their usefulness and capabilities in AD diagnosis. We also highlight some novel identified blood biomarkers (including Aβ42/Aβ43, p-tau 181, Aβ42/APP669-711, structure of Aβ in blood, and flotillin) for AD.",10,3,85,,Pathology; Blood proteins; Neurodegeneration; Asymptomatic; Dementia; Cerebrospinal fluid; Pathogenesis; Medicine; Biomarker (medicine); Amyloid,Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; blood; cerebrospinal fluid,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32806668/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7564023 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7564023 https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/10/3/85 https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/10/3/85/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jpm10030085,32806668,10.3390/jpm10030085,3048923498,PMC7564023,0,001-642-927-716-890; 002-658-366-479-372; 002-937-169-346-759; 003-898-541-218-444; 004-266-364-361-856; 004-680-288-531-270; 006-279-742-358-730; 006-303-600-658-284; 006-378-073-810-809; 006-385-822-354-704; 008-752-463-870-33X; 008-775-746-208-049; 009-247-486-549-230; 009-601-932-716-991; 009-821-527-879-88X; 010-411-610-894-398; 010-809-463-515-043; 010-990-786-140-88X; 013-276-499-116-503; 013-315-422-766-814; 013-464-444-711-75X; 014-554-761-388-648; 016-527-499-301-445; 016-742-524-140-914; 017-683-841-272-987; 018-109-459-913-368; 018-325-705-829-783; 021-729-993-182-775; 022-997-202-434-591; 023-993-466-895-103; 024-912-441-933-571; 024-957-238-876-371; 025-168-326-787-541; 025-878-425-599-77X; 027-867-631-051-595; 028-926-411-719-059; 029-170-143-757-225; 033-645-708-353-617; 034-688-583-163-380; 035-016-352-321-892; 038-308-667-009-231; 038-638-203-364-157; 039-970-422-670-702; 039-990-062-679-84X; 040-086-288-990-286; 041-960-508-412-088; 043-205-277-000-601; 044-392-766-567-070; 046-029-265-584-629; 049-884-241-232-983; 050-125-936-255-83X; 050-760-982-075-509; 051-052-305-895-584; 052-483-728-804-999; 053-282-461-653-508; 053-323-866-277-385; 053-394-436-397-06X; 053-630-575-942-613; 054-203-464-972-588; 054-728-161-634-823; 056-497-916-579-146; 057-024-402-233-152; 057-938-213-365-827; 058-937-650-867-368; 059-221-658-949-299; 059-721-544-004-888; 062-061-819-555-708; 063-078-053-818-152; 064-376-689-476-858; 066-699-975-236-694; 067-850-495-836-434; 071-109-612-061-897; 072-575-825-968-921; 075-629-450-919-25X; 077-595-749-119-206; 083-460-748-677-416; 084-256-604-206-410; 084-363-945-646-709; 085-461-949-626-997; 086-182-922-619-580; 090-707-800-034-406; 092-007-236-091-818; 092-225-092-476-748; 099-463-741-269-676; 101-775-186-574-016; 105-050-757-343-455; 117-056-145-970-485; 127-547-684-784-699; 128-734-855-801-810; 130-107-602-646-567; 132-405-600-172-802; 152-381-050-582-453; 156-360-951-631-403,51,true,cc-by,gold

Particular attention has been focused on measuring volumes of brain structures. Only few studies have investigated whether the cerebellar volume changes with the stage of dementia. It is controversial whether the serum apolipoprotein E (ApoE) level is an appropriate AD marker. This study was designed to clarify the significance of both cerebellar volume measurements and ApoE level measurements as markers of neurodegenerative changes. This study included 55 subjects with AD, 30 subjects with mild cognitive impairments (MCI), and a control group with 30 subjects. We measured the brain, cerebellum, and brain stem volumes with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We determined serum ApoE levels, APOE genotypes, and neuropsychological test scores. In the control group, we found that ApoE levels were significantly higher for subjects with the APOE 2/3 genotype than those with the 4/4 genotype. This finding may indicate that ApoE plays a protective role against AD development in subjects with the APOE 2/3 genotype. ApoE levels were not significantly different in patients with AD and MCI. No correlations were found between serum ApoE levels and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores or the volumes of brain structures. This study could not confirm the appropriateness of the cerebellum volume as an early AD marker.

Clinical,22131582,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Nick Corriveau-Lecavalier; Samira Mellah; Francis Clément; Sylvie Belleville,"Hyperactivation, which is defined as a higher level of activation in patients compared to cognitively unimpaired older adults (controls; CTL), might represent an early signature of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The goal of this study was to assess the presence and location of hyperactivation in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who were later diagnosed with dementia, examine how hyperactivation changes longitudinally, and whether it is related to time before dementia. Forty participants, 26 with MCI and 14 CTL were enrolled in the study. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure functional activation while participants encoded word-pairs as well as cortical thickness and regional brain volume at study entry (Y0) and two years later (Y2). Clinical follow-up was completed every two years following study entry to identify progressors (pMCI), that is, individuals who later received a diagnosis of dementia. Task-related activation was assessed in pMCI in both hippocampi and in regions showing greater cortical thinning from Y0 to Y2 compared to CTLs. Hyperactivation was found in pMCI individuals in the right supramarginal gyrus. Persons with pMCI also showed hypoactivation in the left hippocampus and left pars opercularis. Both hyper- and hypoactivation were present at Y0 and Y2 and did not change longitudinally. Activation was not associated with time before dementia diagnosis. Smaller volume and thinner cortical thickness were associated with shorter time to diagnosis in the left hippocampus and left pars opercularis. In conclusion, hyperactivation was found in individuals who later progressed to dementia, confirming that it might represent an early biomarker to identify individuals in the prodromal phase of AD and that its understanding could contribute to elucidate the key brain mechanisms that precede dementia.",24,,101958,101958,Magnetic resonance imaging; Hyperactivation; Disease; Dementia; Cognitive impairment; Audiology; Brain size; Medicine; Biomarker (medicine); Episodic memory,Alzheimer's disease; Episodic memory; Longitudinal fMRI; Mild cognitive impairment; Task-related hyperactivation,Aged; Alzheimer Disease/physiopathology; Brain/physiopathology; Brain Mapping; Cognitive Dysfunction/physiopathology; Dementia/physiopathology; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged,,CIHR (395361) Canada,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158219303080 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31357150 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31357150/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31357150 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213158219303080 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6664199,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101958,31357150,10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101958,2964205534,PMC6664199,0,000-580-730-380-660; 001-006-258-715-462; 002-060-095-449-633; 002-119-243-086-699; 002-796-015-264-48X; 003-501-145-132-915; 003-635-202-499-515; 005-815-500-451-035; 006-034-350-246-101; 007-867-665-073-084; 008-486-947-460-207; 008-956-096-395-649; 009-254-133-775-457; 011-342-416-242-230; 013-192-195-485-598; 014-090-307-714-324; 015-400-680-175-020; 018-491-103-690-490; 020-361-593-258-639; 020-798-450-711-581; 021-380-565-726-511; 021-538-124-172-864; 022-526-255-470-368; 022-555-150-248-464; 022-988-712-445-94X; 024-023-094-073-879; 024-915-754-540-385; 025-180-677-528-80X; 025-654-194-606-860; 026-890-700-165-14X; 027-288-587-582-738; 028-268-750-862-982; 028-795-962-502-158; 033-253-770-689-477; 033-620-120-989-576; 034-807-140-999-540; 038-246-810-225-893; 039-596-690-287-817; 039-647-920-496-030; 043-780-957-503-553; 044-734-534-546-155; 046-703-362-000-965; 048-536-112-681-339; 048-798-234-162-73X; 051-821-597-883-043; 052-053-536-938-394; 052-299-374-167-477; 052-889-708-622-901; 055-779-066-831-198; 056-626-982-296-679; 056-641-678-440-715; 057-617-716-362-946; 057-650-881-219-910; 063-213-976-022-936; 064-199-110-036-446; 066-279-210-689-172; 071-051-014-781-094; 071-249-530-618-502; 073-512-802-288-93X; 073-996-236-392-698; 075-619-499-096-398; 075-712-792-686-668; 078-280-006-576-49X; 083-020-890-325-455; 086-528-145-400-263; 087-545-297-289-85X; 088-208-419-306-793; 089-014-295-999-217; 095-482-124-872-697; 096-593-525-239-137; 100-855-359-024-973; 102-561-445-203-520; 107-171-986-410-600; 112-521-421-171-866; 113-262-845-284-090; 113-973-431-964-847; 117-459-679-694-186; 117-875-739-530-961; 122-352-441-215-924; 137-559-759-905-59X; 157-858-420-746-441; 164-061-870-677-231; 171-558-299-412-644; 174-990-232-788-198,31,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Höglinger,"Background; Clinical differentiation of parkinsonian syndromes is still challenging.; ; Objectives; A fully automated method for quantitative MRI analysis using atlas-based volumetry combined with support vector machine classification was evaluated for differentiation of parkinsonian syndromes in a multicenter study.; ; Methods; Atlas-based volumetry was performed on MRI data of healthy controls (n = 73) and patients with PD (204), PSP with Richardson's syndrome phenotype (106), MSA of the cerebellar type (21), and MSA of the Parkinsonian type (60), acquired on different scanners. Volumetric results were used as input for support vector machine classification of single subjects with leave-one-out cross-validation.; ; Results; The largest atrophy compared to controls was found for PSP with Richardson's syndrome phenotype patients in midbrain (−15%), midsagittal midbrain tegmentum plane (−20%), and superior cerebellar peduncles (−13%), for MSA of the cerebellar type in pons (−33%), cerebellum (−23%), and middle cerebellar peduncles (−36%), and for MSA of the parkinsonian type in the putamen (−23%). The majority of binary support vector machine classifications between the groups resulted in balanced accuracies of >80%. With MSA of the cerebellar and parkinsonian type combined in one group, support vector machine classification of PD, PSP and MSA achieved sensitivities of 79% to 87% and specificities of 87% to 96%. Extraction of weighting factors confirmed that midbrain, basal ganglia, and cerebellar peduncles had the largest relevance for classification.; ; Conclusions; Brain volumetry combined with support vector machine classification allowed for reliable automated differentiation of parkinsonian syndromes on single-patient level even for MRI acquired on different scanners. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society",31,10,1506,1517,Pathology; Psychology; Midbrain tegmentum; Basal ganglia; Pons; Cerebellum; Putamen; Atrophy; Parkinsonian syndromes; Midbrain,Parkinson's disease; magnetic resonance imaging; multiple system atrophy; progressive supranuclear palsy; support vector machine; volumetry,"Brain/diagnostic imaging; Cerebellar Diseases/diagnostic imaging; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Multiple System Atrophy/diagnostic imaging; Parkinsonian Disorders/classification; Support Vector Machine; Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive/diagnostic imaging",,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Swiss Epilepsy Foundation,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mds.26715 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27452874 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.26715/abstract https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.26715 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27452874,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.26715,27452874,10.1002/mds.26715,2495647680,,1,001-471-286-409-431; 002-264-595-438-37X; 003-072-360-028-376; 003-774-001-058-852; 004-146-296-520-715; 005-656-484-258-941; 005-693-125-797-014; 005-717-986-971-33X; 007-031-344-087-266; 007-684-109-236-039; 010-122-506-255-261; 010-342-610-977-218; 010-425-463-165-810; 011-553-896-742-073; 012-964-805-384-382; 013-153-141-464-247; 013-309-723-983-352; 014-901-247-893-186; 015-363-076-435-324; 016-166-830-061-058; 016-909-686-240-143; 018-014-492-976-713; 018-289-729-138-746; 019-293-776-714-206; 020-441-134-826-481; 022-894-822-051-67X; 023-928-444-110-407; 024-946-339-012-317; 026-766-796-792-229; 027-929-592-149-063; 030-957-366-331-760; 031-136-752-436-374; 032-861-909-903-830; 033-358-994-721-430; 033-620-120-989-576; 038-857-782-390-594; 041-464-657-117-696; 043-610-036-726-654; 048-574-277-653-683; 048-810-622-046-174; 050-512-067-720-356; 050-812-577-061-607; 054-324-384-245-47X; 058-598-906-307-281; 063-206-952-779-402; 063-904-248-219-696; 066-204-418-698-792; 070-045-748-497-888; 072-792-891-808-046; 073-771-074-618-131; 073-946-160-095-324; 078-924-850-214-305; 083-739-599-831-659; 084-272-563-631-364; 086-536-015-808-471; 089-395-337-913-875; 097-026-801-239-092; 097-593-262-735-556; 102-855-065-117-181; 106-619-784-556-296; 110-793-459-121-756; 126-806-352-582-959; 136-875-965-130-324; 158-490-101-515-711; 175-086-801-946-514,128,false,,

The role of such established or putative biomarkers is to allow an accurate diagnosis of AD, to infer about its prognosis, to monitor disease progression and evaluate changes induced by disease-modifying drugs. An ideal biomarker should detect a specific pathophysiological feature of AD, not present in the healthy condition, in other primary dementias, or in confounding conditions. Besides being reliable, a biomarker should be detectable by means of procedures which must be relatively non-invasive, simple to perform, widely available and not too expensive. At present, no candidate meets these requirements representing the high standards aimed at by researchers. Among others, various morphological brain measures performed by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ranging from the total brain volume to some restricted regions such as the hippocampal volume, have been proposed. Nowadays the efforts are directed toward finding an automated, unsupervised method of evaluating atrophy in some specific brain region, such as the medial temporal lobe (MTL). In this work we provide an extensive review of the state of the art on the automatic and semi-automatic image processing techniques for the early assessment of patients at risk of developing AD. Our main focus is the relevance of the morphological analysis of MTL, and in particular of the hippocampal formation, in making the diagnosis of AD and in distinguishing it from other dementias.",2,1,31,39,Pathology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Hippocampal formation; Neuroscience; Disease; Temporal lobe; Atrophy; Brain size; Medicine; Feature (computer vision); Biomarker (medicine),,,,,https://benthamopen.com/ABSTRACT/TONMEDJ-2-31 https://iris.unige.it/handle/11567/250517,http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1876388x01002010031,,10.2174/1876388x01002010031,1978683696,,0,002-361-551-225-123; 004-675-102-505-917; 004-836-707-391-304; 008-736-311-002-891; 009-084-337-376-715; 009-773-242-304-237; 009-780-227-950-711; 011-082-331-917-210; 011-528-296-152-403; 012-720-376-255-353; 012-833-270-606-662; 012-868-181-805-600; 012-991-932-833-148; 013-682-875-212-421; 014-548-664-149-986; 015-589-381-033-833; 016-198-841-742-293; 016-652-933-184-310; 018-011-887-512-928; 019-825-562-291-433; 019-948-220-115-667; 021-047-409-056-748; 021-278-685-376-121; 022-393-887-037-11X; 022-480-473-968-534; 022-555-150-248-464; 023-921-038-262-008; 024-023-094-073-879; 028-599-342-826-727; 028-630-202-484-369; 028-641-859-856-175; 029-319-902-294-683; 029-351-686-260-568; 029-353-618-354-043; 029-910-535-416-172; 031-818-054-450-257; 032-129-513-254-072; 034-065-901-270-632; 034-527-861-863-356; 037-313-448-344-443; 037-875-975-236-430; 038-842-922-801-075; 040-133-460-794-754; 040-572-084-289-272; 040-836-174-613-474; 041-774-362-234-004; 044-707-402-422-00X; 045-277-706-273-567; 046-336-421-015-20X; 046-436-194-323-808; 048-536-112-681-339; 049-387-337-026-052; 050-304-999-024-119; 052-422-951-458-081; 058-421-296-130-111; 062-589-806-143-822; 064-055-010-382-533; 064-372-540-475-533; 065-182-236-634-746; 072-716-367-518-822; 074-039-777-711-884; 074-426-471-590-338; 078-766-973-286-332; 083-020-890-325-455; 087-068-978-281-782; 087-932-434-541-59X; 089-709-783-805-531; 092-551-829-858-702; 097-736-970-676-193; 100-388-306-690-841; 100-758-926-286-976; 101-619-456-145-285; 106-375-919-283-857; 109-887-763-159-89X; 110-190-021-928-771; 111-893-410-195-580; 113-078-205-543-250; 113-220-824-400-659; 116-213-991-702-519; 121-740-559-162-731; 126-301-057-800-761; 127-453-490-884-643; 131-756-174-644-245; 135-714-675-550-909; 149-183-343-361-157,0,true,,bronze
091-131-123-327-582,Locally linear embedding (LLE) for MRI based Alzheimer's disease classification.,2013-06-21,2013,journal article,NeuroImage,10959572; 10538119,Elsevier BV,United States,Xin Liu; Duygu Tosun; Michael W. Weiner; Norbert Schuff; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative,"Modern machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used in neuroimaging studies, such as the prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from structural MRI. However, finding a good representation for multivariate brain MRI features in which their essential structure is revealed and easily extractable has been difficult. We report a successful application of a machine learning framework that significantly improved the use of brain MRI for predictions. Specifically, we used the unsupervised learning algorithm of local linear embedding (LLE) to transform multivariate MRI data of regional brain volume and cortical thickness to a locally linear space with fewer dimensions, while also utilizing the global nonlinear data structure. The embedded brain features were then used to train a classifier for predicting future conversion to AD based on a baseline MRI. We tested the approach on 413 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had baseline MRI scans and complete clinical follow-ups over 3 years with the following diagnoses: cognitive normal (CN; n=137), stable mild cognitive impairment (s-MCI; n=93), MCI converters to AD (c-MCI, n=97), and AD (n=86). We found that classifications using embedded MRI features generally outperformed (p<0.05) classifications using the original features directly. Moreover, the improvement from LLE was not limited to a particular classifier but worked equally well for regularized logistic regressions, support vector machines, and linear discriminant analysis. Most strikingly, using LLE significantly improved (p=0.007) predictions of MCI subjects who converted to AD and those who remained stable (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity: =0.68/0.80/0.56). In contrast, predictions using the original features performed not better than by chance (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity: =0.56/0.65/0.46). In conclusion, LLE is a very effective tool for classification studies of AD using multivariate MRI data. The improvement in predicting conversion to AD in MCI could have important implications for health management and for powering therapeutic trials by targeting non-demented subjects who later convert to AD.",83,,148,157,Machine learning; Support vector machine; Logistic regression; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Multivariate statistics; Cognition; Pattern recognition; Medical diagnosis; Neuroimaging; Brain size; Linear discriminant analysis,Alzheimer's disease; Classification of AD; Locally linear embedding; MRI; Statistical learning,"Aged; Algorithms; Alzheimer Disease/pathology; Artificial Intelligence; Brain/pathology; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement/methods; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/methods; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Male; Middle Aged; Pattern Recognition, Automated/methods; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",,NIA NIH HHS (K01 AG030514) United States; NIA NIH HHS (U01 AG024904) United States; NCRR NIH HHS (P41 RR023953) United States; NIBIB NIH HHS (T32 EB001631) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG010129) United States,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811913006708 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.06.033 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.06.033 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23792982/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3815961 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3815961/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811913006708 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/neuroimage/neuroimage83.html#LiuTWS13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.06.033,23792982,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.06.033,2072188503,PMC3815961,2,004-562-487-736-159; 004-615-343-305-292; 005-121-068-159-361; 006-780-944-386-659; 007-446-871-421-830; 008-989-867-184-42X; 010-155-244-775-240; 012-745-442-797-945; 013-724-909-206-162; 013-874-665-128-711; 014-874-181-356-060; 016-318-565-834-127; 016-363-115-822-922; 018-303-431-122-010; 020-783-254-615-208; 021-254-065-724-459; 022-764-013-109-311; 022-988-712-445-94X; 023-014-725-113-97X; 023-454-822-028-688; 026-325-982-001-167; 027-637-887-931-488; 028-938-354-899-02X; 029-700-853-901-151; 031-818-054-450-257; 032-430-404-412-839; 033-253-770-689-477; 033-438-482-070-195; 035-771-620-854-679; 035-810-977-979-043; 036-470-745-316-716; 036-803-586-292-27X; 040-208-886-145-325; 043-139-464-319-842; 043-348-573-940-487; 046-304-946-983-717; 050-427-217-530-149; 051-355-078-161-238; 053-678-293-807-694; 058-947-710-311-599; 059-786-079-109-47X; 067-624-188-366-473; 067-725-299-945-040; 069-192-124-528-556; 069-245-013-350-093; 074-075-980-380-943; 076-477-636-815-885; 077-273-307-091-97X; 078-952-734-187-096; 084-706-486-004-505; 090-808-538-267-556; 091-439-295-854-187; 091-548-214-348-665; 093-965-309-111-88X; 097-485-318-728-585; 107-047-810-084-137; 108-092-874-801-827; 116-008-284-714-614; 116-726-708-427-050; 139-311-867-879-564; 141-266-442-791-016; 141-777-336-993-997; 143-290-114-316-235; 152-419-559-201-263; 174-990-232-788-198; 184-446-291-593-247,146,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Rojas; Elliot Sandberg,"This paper summarizes the findings of a long term study addressing the question of how several brain volume measure are related to three major mental illnesses in a Colorado subject group. It reports results obtained from a large N, collected and analyzed by the same laboratory over a multiyear period, with visually guided MRI segmentation being the primary initial analytic tool. Intracerebral volume (ICV), total brain volume (TBV), ventricular volume (VV), ventricular/brain ratio (VBR), and TBV/ICV ratios were calculated from a total of 224 subject MRIs collected over a period of 13 years. Subject groups included controls (C, N = 89), and patients with schizophrenia (SZ, N = 58), bipolar disorder (BD, N = 51), and schizoaffective disorder (SAD, N = 26). ICV, TBV, and VV measures compared favorably with values obtained by other research groups, but in this study did not differ significantly between groups. TBV/ICV ratios were significantly decreased, and VBR increased, in the SZ and BD groups compared to the C group. The SAD group did not differ from C on any measure. In this study TBV/ICV and VBR ratios separated SZ and BD patients from controls. Of interest however, SAD patients did not differ from controls on these measures. The findings suggest that the gross measure of TBV may not reliably differ in the major mental illnesses to a degree useful in diagnosis, likely due to the intrinsic variability of the measures in question; the differences in VBR appear more robust across studies. Differences in some of these findings compared to earlier reports from several laboratories finding significant differences between groups in VV and TBV may relate to phenomenological drift, differences in analytic techniques, and possibly the ""file drawer problem"".",10,1,79,79,Psychiatry; Internal medicine; Magnetic resonance imaging; Psychology; Cardiology; Bipolar disorder; Mental illness; Schizoaffective disorder; Atrophy; Brain size; Schizophrenia; Analysis of variance,,"Adult; Age Factors; Analysis of Variance; Atrophy; Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis; Brain/anatomy & histology; Cerebral Ventricles/anatomy & histology; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/statistics & numerical data; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Male; Mental Disorders/diagnosis; Organ Size; Psychotic Disorders/diagnosis; Schizophrenia/diagnosis; Sex Factors",,NIMH NIH HHS (R01 MH060214) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (MH64502) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (MH47476) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (MH 088623) United States,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/20937136 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-244X-10-79/fulltext.html https://paperity.org/p/57175243/brain-size-and-brain-intracranial-volume-ratio-in-major-mental-illness https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958994/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20937136 https://link.springer.com/10.1186%2F1471-244X-10-79 https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-10-79 https://0-bmcpsychiatry-biomedcentral-com.brum.beds.ac.uk/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-10-79 https://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/10/79/prepub https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-244X-10-79,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-244x-10-79,20937136,10.1186/1471-244x-10-79,2157791683,PMC2958994,0,001-499-663-445-492; 003-748-418-870-978; 004-177-154-305-907; 005-832-969-429-26X; 005-843-831-741-166; 007-263-344-831-481; 010-436-190-437-545; 016-111-054-576-754; 017-777-928-736-024; 022-555-940-661-894; 024-211-770-348-160; 029-788-526-033-616; 032-539-533-614-487; 032-744-544-858-607; 036-185-905-473-786; 044-033-095-921-272; 046-199-084-624-208; 053-831-803-319-104; 057-314-941-437-299; 059-094-719-560-027; 076-629-374-010-824; 076-937-571-051-048; 079-284-547-955-091; 079-615-870-656-124; 080-670-158-228-107; 081-345-148-815-700; 092-647-442-356-448; 102-359-738-667-581; 118-932-658-443-06X; 121-830-356-032-565; 132-999-999-617-842; 179-680-347-083-882; 188-761-203-159-586,30,true,"CC BY, CC0",gold

Kennedy; Christian Haselgrove; Steven M. Hodge; Pallavi Rane; Nikos Makris; Jean A. Frazier,"There are numerous psychiatric disorders that can plague the development of children. Each of these disorders manifests as a distinct pattern of clinical, behavioral, etiological, neuroanatomic and neurofunctional characteristics that challenge the management of the individual patient, as well as the development of successful intervention and prevention strategies. In the area of neuroimaging, a substantial number of studies have been performed to date; and while much has been learned from this investment, this represents only the tip-of-the-iceberg of the information that can be gleaned from the data. Unfortunately, most of this additional, untapped information resource is lost due to ineffective sharing of the data that is possible by application of current technologies.; ; The Child and Adolescent NeuroDevelopment Initiative (CANDI) at University of Massachusetts Medical School is making available a series of structural brain images, as well as their anatomic segmentations and demographic data, as a coordinated set of related morphometric resources. The initial data set is a release of 103 subjects (T1-weighted MRI scans and anatomic segmentation) that comprised the neuroanatomic data published in 2008 in an article by Frazier, et al.1 The subjects include 57 males and 46 females, aged 4–17, and come from four diagnostic groups: Healthy Controls (N=29), Schizophrenia Spectrum (N=20), Bipolar Disorder with Psychosis (N=19), and Bipolar Disorder without Psychosis (N=35).; ; Both the McLean Hospital and Cambridge Health Alliance Institutional Review Boards approved the original data acquisition research protocols. All subjects signed assent forms, and their parents/legal guardians signed informed consent forms. The University of Massachusetts Medical School Institutional Review Board approved the data sharing protocol. Images were acquired from 1996–2006 at the McLean Hospital Brain Imaging Center on a 1.5 Tesla General Electric Signa Scanner. Structural imaging was performed using a three-dimensional inversion recovery-prepared spoiled gradient recalled echo in the coronal plane with 124 1.5 mm thick slices, repetition time 10 ms, TE 3, flip angle 25°, field of view 24 cm, acquisition matrix 256×192 and 2 excitations.2 All scans were reviewed by a clinical neuroradiologist to rule out gross pathology. The MR images released have undergone analysis at the Center for Morphometric Analysis (CMA) at the Massachusetts General Hospital which includes: preprocessing (‘positional normalization’ to put the image into the standard orientation of the Talairach coordinate space,3 and bias field correction4) and ‘general segmentation’ following the CMA segmentation protocol.5 Segmented regions include: Cerebral Cortex and White Matter, Cerebellum Cortex and White Matter, Lateral Ventricle, Thalamus, Ventral Diencephalon, Caudate, Putamen, Pallidum, Accumbens, Hippocampus and Amygdala, bilaterally; as well as Brain Stem, 3rd and 4th ventricles. Basic demographic details for each subject include diagnosis, age, gender, and handedness (Fig. 1).; ; ; ; Fig. 1; ; The figure shows the data and resource relationships accessible from the CANDIShare data release. From the CANDIShare NITRC download page, both version V1.0 and V1.1 can be accessed. Accessing V1.1 for the healthy control group (HC) gains the user access ...; ; ; ; The release is provided under the Creative Commons: Attribute license,6 and is structured as four bundles (tar) of imaging data, one for each diagnostic group. Within each bundle, there are separate directories for each subject that includes the data. Release version V1.0 includes only the imaging data and basic demographics and is accessible with no limitations. Version V1.1 adds the segmentation data as an indexed label file in register with the MR image for each subject, and requires provision of a contact email address (via the NITRC registration process) and requires a ‘clickthrough’ acceptance of the licensing terms. We do not perceive these extra access ‘hoops’ as burdensome, but they are necessary. While we hope that the data provided are perfect and free of any errors, experience has taught that some unforeseen errors may be present. If found, we will correct any error, and re-release a new version of the data and are obligated to inform all prior users of the data of any errors and corrections that were necessitated in order to limit the impact of any errors.; ; In addition to the image releases, the CANDIShare portal begins to establish a more richly interconnected set of related informatics resources. The first example of this is the inclusion of linkages between each data release and their representation in the Internet Brain Volume Database (IBVD).7 The IBVD is a web-based database of published brain neuroanatomic volumetric observations. As the images and segmentation in this data release supports the volumetric observations in a specific publication, this linkage completes the connection between the high-level, group volumetric observation and the detailed individualized data that supports it. As the IBVD is also interoperable with PubMed via the ‘Link-Out’ function, a PubMed user can get from the publication listing at PubMed, to the summary volumetric observations reported in IBVD, to the raw data that supports the observation in the CANDIShare data release. Each of the diagnostic group bundles are linked to their respective group pages in the IBVD via the link exposed at the download page of the NITRC project.; ; This image and segmentation data release for a specific publication represents the first in a series of data representing the pediatric brain in health and disease from data collected in our lab over the past 15 years. Additional publications will be added, and more resource interconnectivity will be included to maximize the utility of the released data with other classes of available data. This release of information is designed to be dramatically greater than merely ‘making the images available’: each image is associated with substantial analytic results, many of which have been utilized in the preparation of various publications and comparisons. Moreover, these data will be most effectively shared with the research community when shared in a way that preserves the linkages between the images, the resultant analytic data and meta-data, and its relationships to other public sources of related information. The utility of this shared data includes potentially expanding the numbers of subjects available for other studies (when the imaging protocols are comparable), facilitating additional research findings in this specific data set through reuse by other laboratories, and additional community access to accurate, manually-labeled datasets to promote development and testing of data analysis software. Access to data of this sort has already been valuable in development of numerous analysis techniques.8 In short, this represents a ‘Knowledge Management’ environment that will facilitate traversal of these data and linkages.",10,3,319,322,Machine learning; Raw data; Artificial intelligence; Set (psychology); Informatics; Information retrieval; Data sharing; Protocol (science); Computer science; Data access; Data set; Orientation (computer vision),,Brain/pathology; Child; Health Resources/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Information Dissemination; Mental Disorders/diagnosis; Neuroimaging; Pediatrics,,NICHD NIH HHS (P30 HD004147) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (R01 MH083320) United States,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12021-011-9133-y https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22006352/ https://escholarship.umassmed.edu/psych_pp/517/ http://www.nitrc.org/docman/view.php/377/1075/CANDIShareNewsItem.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3417225/ https://www.nitrc.org/docman/view.php/377/1075/CANDIShareNewsItem.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3417225 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ni/ni10.html#KennedyHHRMF12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12021-011-9133-y,22006352,10.1007/s12021-011-9133-y,1969094805,PMC3417225,0,006-755-777-296-01X; 019-875-777-838-761; 031-818-054-450-257; 041-464-657-117-696; 053-278-004-171-771; 060-023-913-747-765; 060-503-884-327-712,69,true,,green

097-253-011-428-796,Mean deviation based identification of activated voxels from time-series fMRI data of schizophrenia patients.,2018-10-08,2018,journal article,F1000Research,20461402,F1000 Research Ltd,United Kingdom,Indranath Chatterjee,"Background: Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness affecting different regions of the brain, which causes symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the most popular technique to study the functional activation patterns of the brain. The fMRI data is four-dimensional, composed of 3D brain images over time. Each voxel of the 3D brain volume is associated with a time series of signal intensity values. This study aimed to identify the distinct voxels from time-series fMRI data that show high functional activation during a task. Methods: In this study, a novel mean-deviation based approach was applied to time-series fMRI data of 34 schizophrenia patients and 34 healthy subjects. The statistical measures such as mean and median were used to find the functional changes in each voxel over time. The voxels that show significant changes for each subject were selected and thus used as the feature set during the classification of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Results: The proposed approach identifies a set of relevant voxels that are used to distinguish between healthy and schizophrenia subjects with high classification accuracy. The study shows functional changes in brain regions such as superior frontal gyrus, cuneus, medial frontal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus. Conclusions: This work describes a simple yet novel feature selection algorithm for time-series fMRI data to identify the activated brain voxels that are generally affected in schizophrenia. The brain regions identified in this study may further help clinicians to understand the illness for better medical intervention. It may be possible to explore the approach to fMRI data of other psychological disorders.",7,,1615,1615,Neuroscience; Superior frontal gyrus; Superior temporal gyrus; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Cuneus; Medial frontal gyrus; Voxel; Brain size; Medicine; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming); Parahippocampal gyrus; Middle temporal gyrus; Lingual gyrus; Voxel-based morphometry; Psychology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Precuneus; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; White matter; Temporal lobe; Psychiatry; Radiology; Epilepsy,Classification; Schizophrenia; Time-series; fMRI,,,NCRR NIH HHS (U24 RR021992) United States,https://f1000research.com/articles/7-1615/v2/pdf https://f1000research.com/articles/7-1615 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6338245 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/30687497,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.16405.1,30687497,10.12688/f1000research.16405.1; 10.12688/f1000research.16405.2,2895262201,PMC6338245,0,001-679-462-541-128; 002-970-691-229-832; 003-399-424-387-859; 003-794-941-075-271; 003-841-098-795-679; 004-548-216-624-242; 006-564-571-420-36X; 007-592-618-050-058; 008-801-259-463-559; 009-795-686-488-353; 014-380-164-606-849; 014-680-436-309-560; 017-450-505-132-566; 021-089-376-283-711; 021-562-577-196-906; 024-957-223-666-371; 026-586-293-929-176; 026-700-348-933-874; 028-576-049-043-65X; 030-219-542-759-930; 030-687-130-483-680; 039-594-870-073-198; 041-124-417-157-92X; 042-932-056-430-004; 044-186-923-134-301; 045-115-875-038-056; 046-997-416-812-640; 047-687-563-962-270; 051-084-310-152-554; 052-103-757-576-596; 053-909-977-766-278; 054-936-140-021-143; 055-702-221-404-490; 062-381-547-133-044; 071-026-823-206-765; 072-559-260-902-078; 082-599-693-825-185; 086-814-319-046-59X; 092-307-014-407-121; 095-519-001-194-976; 097-253-011-428-796; 097-485-318-728-585; 097-589-742-759-651; 098-762-170-984-468; 107-730-924-229-003; 132-528-927-767-007; 133-193-069-683-572; 144-503-208-667-231,19,true,cc-by,gold

Evans; Charles DeCarli,"Population-based MRI studies have contributed substantially to our understanding of the associations of structural brain changes to cognition and dementia. Most studies have used qualitative MRI measures on Caucasian populations, and none to date have examined longitudinal change. We present preliminary MRI data from the Chicago Healthy Aging Project (CHAP), a longitudinal study of aging and Alzheimer's disease in an urban biracial community population. We examined racial differences in the association between brain atrophy and change in cognitive performance. 27 cognitively normal individuals (NCI), 11 MCI and 8 AD subjects with a mean age of 83 ± 4.8 years (70% African American; 48% female) were imaged twice over 3.4 ± 1.9 years. Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) was used to measure brain volume (Figure 1); permutation and cluster size were used to correct for multiple comparisons (Figure 2). Average total brain volumes were 952 ± 107 cc (baseline) and 914 ± 101 cc (follow-up). Change in brain volume (computed as annualized percent) differed significantly by diagnosis (F(2,40)=7.57, p=0.0016) after adjusting for age, gender and ethnicity, declining at 1.2% per year for persons with NCI, 1.1% for MCI , 2.2% for AD. . Change in brain volume was significantly associated with change in global (F(1,41)=5.6, p=0.03) and episodic memory performance (F(1,41)=8.3, p=0.0087). Average hippocampal volumes were 3.63 ± 0.63 cc (baseline) and 3.40 ± 0.67 cc (follow-up). Again, the rate of hippocampal atrophy differed significantly by diagnosis (F(2,40)=7.57, p=0.0016): Hippocampal volume declined 1.6% per year for persons with NCI, 1.8% for MCI, 4.9% for AD. Annualized change in percent hippocampal volume was significantly associated with change in global cognition (F(1,41)=5.4, p=0.02). No significant ethnic differences were found with any of these comparisons. In this small study, the annualized change in the AD group for both total brain and hippocampal volumes was consistent with previous reports from cohorts of convenience. Atrophy rates were significantly associated with cognitive impairment, with no apparent effect of ethnicity on these associations.",4,4S_Part_8,,,Atrophy; Brain size; Dementia; Cognitive decline; Population; Medicine; Longitudinal study; Gerontology; Cognition; Internal medicine; Psychology; Disease; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pathology; Psychiatry; Radiology; Environmental health,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2008.05.804,,10.1016/j.jalz.2008.05.804,,,0,,0,false,,

Tijms; Mara ten Kate; Sander C.J. Verfaillie; Alida A. Gouw; Charlotte E. Teunissen; Frederik Barkhof; Philip Scheltens; Wiesje M. van der Flier,"Accumulation of amyloid in the brain is among the first changes leading to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet its prognostic value is limited. Grey matter connectivity is disrupted in AD, and these disruptions are associated with worse cognitive functioning. We studied whether grey matter connectivity has prognostic value, by comparing amyloid positive patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and analyzing its association with clinical progression. CODA (COnnectivity in DementiA) includes 222 non-demented patients (62 (28%) SCD; 160 (78%) MCI; 109 (49%) female, 68 ± 8 years; 28 ± 2.4 MMSE) with abnormal amyloid CSF (<640 pg/ml), T1-weighted structural MRI and over 1 year annual follow up data available selected from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. The main outcome parameter was clinical progression (i.e., CDR change ≥0.5). Single-subject networks were based on grey matter segmentations. We calculated the degree, connectivity density, path length, clustering, and small world parameters. All measures were Z transformed and inverted. ANCOVAs were used for cross-sectional comparisons of disease outcome and baseline diagnosis. Separate Cox proportional hazard models were fitted for each connectivity predictor for time to dementia onset and corrected for age, gender, whole brain volume and scanner. After 2.2 (IQR 1.3–3.1) years 122 (55%) people showed clinical progression (N=23 SCD; N=99 MCI). Normalized clustering and small world property showed main effects of diagnosis and clinical progression, which is suggestive of a linear trend (Figure 1). Cox analyses indicated that lower values of 5 grey matter network parameters were related to clinical progression: degree (HR = 1.48; 95%CI = 1.09-2.02), connectivity density (HR = 1.49; 95%CI = 1.09-1.81), clustering (HR = 2.92; 95%CI = 1.27–6.69; Figure 2), normalized clustering (HR = 1.47; 95%CI = 1.13-1.91), and small world value (HR = 1.45; 95%CI = 1.13–1.87). No interaction effects of baseline diagnosis and network properties on time to dementia onset were found (all pia >.05). In non-dementia phases of AD, grey matter networks disruptions suggestive of a change towards a more random network organization were associated with time to clinical progression. Our findings suggest that connectivity based markers have prognostic value in amyloid positive individuals. Linear trend analysis of normalized clustering coefficient (gamma) and the small world parameter. Both these network parameters had highest values in patients with subjective cognitive decline who remained stable overtime, and the lowest in MCI patients who progressed to dementia.

Neuropsychopharmacology 2015). Interestingly, prediction accuracy in first-episode psychosis is lower compared to older and probably more chronic patients. One possibility is that the appearance of the neurodiagnostic fingerprints (NF) originated from the schizophrenia vs. controls classifier become more visible over time in schizophrenia due to the progressive nature of the disorder.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>;                <jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>Using the Cobre sample (70 schizophrenia and 74 controls), we trained support vector machine (SVM) to differentiate schizophrenia from controls using sMRI. Next, we utilized the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC 1966) sample of 29 schizophrenia and 61 non-psychotic controls who participated in the nine-year follow-up. We applied the Cobre-trained SVM models at the baseline (participants 34 years old) and the follow-up (participants 43 years old) using out of sample cross-validation without any in-between retraining. Two independent schizophrenia datasets (the Neuromorphometry by Computer Algorithm Chicago [NMorphCH] and the Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics [CNP]) were utilized for replication analyses of the SVM generalizability. To address the possibility that the NF mainly capture some general psychopathology, we tested whether the NF generalize to depression using two independent MDD samples from Munich and Münster, Germany.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>;                <jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>Results</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>Using the Cobre-trained SVM models for schizophrenia vs. controls differentiation in the NFBC 1966, we found balanced accuracy (i.e. mean of sensitivity and specificity, [BAC]) of 72.8% (sensitivity=58.6%, specificity=86.9%) at the baseline and BAC of 79.7% (sensitivity=75.9%, specificity=83.6%) at the follow-up. In the NFBC 1966 schizophrenia patients, we found that SVM decision scores varied as a function of timepoint into the direction of more schizophrenia-likeness at the follow-up (paired T-test, Cohen’s d=0.58, P=0.004). The same was not true in controls (Cohen’s d=0.09, P=0.49). The SVM decision score difference*timepoint interaction related to the decrease of hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. The SVM models’ performance was also validated at the two replication samples (BAC of 77.5% in the CNP and BAC of 69.1% in the NMorphCH). In the NFBC 1966 the strongest clinical variable correlating with the trajectory of SVM decision scores over the follow-up was poor performance in the California Verbal Learning Test. This finding was also replicated in the CNP dataset. Further, in the NFBC 1966, those schizophrenia patients with a low degree of SVM decision scores had a higher probability of being in remission, being able to work, and being without antipsychotic medication at the follow-up. The generalization of the SVM models to MDD was worse compared to schizophrenia classification (DeLong’s tests for the two ROC curves: P&amp;lt;0.001).</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>;                <jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>Discussion</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>The degree of schizophrenia-related neurodiagnostic fingerprints appear to magnify over time in schizophrenia. By contrast, the discernibility of these fingerprints in controls does not change over time. This indicates that the NF captures some schizophrenia-related progressive neural changes, and not, e.g., normal aging-related brain volume loss. The fingerprints were also generalizable to other schizophrenia samples. Further, the fingerprints seem to have some disorder specificity as the SVM models do not generalize to depression. Lastly, it appears that a low degree of schizophrenia-related NF in schizophrenia might possess some value in predicting patients’ future remission and recovery-related factors.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>",46,Supplement_1,S290,S291,Psychology; Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming); Course (navigation); Population based; Clinical psychology; Text mining,,,,,https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article-pdf/46/Supplement_1/S290/33286396/sbaa029.717.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7234296,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbaa029.717,,10.1093/schbul/sbaa029.717,3027819034,,0,,1,true,cc-by-nc,hybrid

To date, the key clinical indication for imaging studies is the exclusion of unexpected but treatable conditions. MRI together with CSF, PET and SPECT is considered a biomarker in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, the most frequent dementia affecting approximately 60% of patients with dementia. Atrophy of the mesial temporal lobe quantified on images acquired perpendicular to a plane defined by the anterior and posterior commissure predicts the rapid development of symptoms in otherwise asymptomatic patients. However, the detection of small changes in brain volume during follow-up imaging requires a voxel based analysis.

In contrast to other studies on MRI-based biomarkers which usually only focus on a single modality, we derived deformation maps from high-dimensional normalization of T1-weighted images, as well as mean diffusivity maps and fractional anisotropy maps from DTI of the same group of 21 patients with AD and 20 healthy controls. Using an automated multivariate analysis of the entire brain volume, widespread decreased white matter integrity and atrophy effects were found in cortical and subcortical regions of AD patients. Mean diffusivity maps and deformation maps were equally effective in discriminating between AD patients and controls (AUC =0.88 vs. AUC=0.85) while fractional anisotropy maps performed slightly inferior. Combining the maps from different modalities in a logistic regression model resulted in a classification accuracy of AUC=0.86 after leave-one-out cross-validation. It remains to be shown if this automated multivariate analysis of DTI-measures can improve early diagnosis of AD in predementia stages.",20,2,477,490,Pathology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Diffusion MRI; Logistic regression; Psychology; Atrophy; Nuclear medicine; Multivariate analysis; Alzheimer's disease; Brain mapping; Fractional anisotropy,,Aged; Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis; Biomarkers; Brain/pathology; Brain Mapping; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Principal Component Analysis; ROC Curve,Biomarkers,,https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad01386 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/20164559 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20164559 https://www.medra.org/servlet/aliasResolver?alias=iospress&doi=10.3233/JAD-2010-1386,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/jad-2010-1386,20164559,10.3233/jad-2010-1386,2156011712,,0,001-614-126-238-747; 002-711-652-059-088; 003-343-082-585-712; 004-236-042-763-193; 005-877-129-341-133; 008-372-947-045-737; 009-641-598-566-321; 009-773-242-304-237; 011-061-917-581-643; 014-258-258-727-626; 014-963-198-697-552; 017-094-845-609-166; 018-981-464-684-143; 021-254-065-724-459; 022-504-010-583-383; 022-988-712-445-94X; 023-293-108-021-468; 023-485-906-951-922; 028-576-049-043-65X; 028-921-800-970-375; 029-701-419-896-067; 033-299-160-377-605; 038-546-354-795-685; 038-695-280-115-745; 040-673-032-325-043; 040-909-254-020-833; 042-508-095-450-275; 046-662-237-160-152; 047-349-753-728-141; 048-536-112-681-339; 048-742-954-550-287; 050-087-144-187-272; 054-847-484-789-709; 062-967-934-632-108; 065-285-990-691-621; 067-102-823-132-695; 068-049-377-075-85X; 074-929-949-504-270; 077-751-338-886-525; 083-549-767-344-095; 087-068-978-281-782; 088-465-150-247-360; 092-769-781-855-271; 106-461-060-968-861; 115-647-518-504-359; 131-777-500-649-221; 147-285-090-437-276,30,false,,

Previous MRI studies of the human amygdala have demonstrated that it undergoes a particularly long postnatal volumetric maturation, extending into adolescence (3–6). Perhaps one of the most highly replicated MRI findings in autism is that the amygdala demonstrates an early increase in volume relative to age-matched nonautistic control subjects (5, 7–9). These earlier studies indicate that the amygdala is already larger by around 3 years of age and continues to expand faster than in nonautistic control children for several years thereafter, at least in a substantial subset of autistic children.The study by Shen et al. reported in this issue (10) has provided important new information on the altered growth of the amygdala in ASD during infancy, prior to the behavioral diagnosis of ASD at 24 months of age. Supported by the unique resource of the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS), which follows infants who have a higher likelihood for ASD by nature of having an older autistic sibling, from 6 to 24 months of age, Shen et al. evaluated amygdala development across infancy at three time points—6, 12, and 24 months of age. In the group of children ultimately diagnosed with ASD, they found that amygdala volume at 6 months did not differ significantly from in the nonautistic children. But the amygdala demonstrated more rapid enlargement between 6 and 24 months in the autistic children and was larger than in the nonautistic children at both 12 and 24 months. The authors conclude that in autistic children, the altered trajectory of amygdala growth begins during infancy, when the behavioral characteristics that will ultimately lead to a diagnosis of autism at 24 months are emerging.A second contribution of the Shen et al. study was to address the issue of whether altered amygdala development occurs in other neurodevelopmental disorders. To do this, they carried out a similar analysis in children diagnosed with fragile X syndrome. In this group, they found no evidence of altered amygdala growth or of increased amygdala volume. In contrast, the caudate nucleus and related basal ganglia structures were enlarged even at the first imaging time point, when the children were 6 months of age. The findings thus highlight very different patterns of altered brain development in these two neurodevelopmental disorders. One remaining question is whether children with fragile X syndrome and co-occurring autism demonstrate a different amygdala trajectory from those with fragile X syndrome only. Also, given that previous studies have found smaller amygdala volume in preschool-age children with fragile X syndrome compared to nonautistic and autistic children (11), the question of when amygdala development diverges in fragile X syndrome remains open.A final point made by Shen et al. is that the rapid amygdala growth in autistic children was associated with increased social impairment as measured with the social affect component of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule calibrated severity score but not with the restricted, repetitive behaviors severity score. This is consistent with previous studies indicating a link between altered amygdala development and the social impairments of ASD (7, 9, 12). However, the role of the amygdala in social behavior and in the alterations of social behavior in autism remains murky.Based on nonhuman primate studies, we have argued (13) that the amygdala may play a limited role in the development and regulation of species’ typical social behavior. This view is supported by studies of patients with Urbach-Wiethe syndrome who have complete bilateral loss of the amygdala (14, 15). These individuals do not have social perceptual deficits similar to those in autistic individuals and are not diagnosed with ASD. They do, however, demonstrate profoundly altered fear responses and reduced anxiety (16), which is similar to what is observed in nonhuman primates with amygdala lesions (17). The amygdala is clearly involved in the mediation of fear responses and in the manifestation of anxiety in humans (18–21). Considering the role of the amygdala in anxiety can potentially provide greater insight into the relationship between altered amygdala development and autism, but the situation is complicated.Our group recently showed (22) that 69% of a large cohort of autistic children who were followed longitudinally from early diagnosis (∼3 years of age) into middle childhood (∼11 years of age) also have a co-occurring anxiety disorder. However, there were various forms of anxiety among them: 21% had DSM-specified anxiety disorders, 17% had autism-related “distinct” anxiety, and 31% had both forms. Distinct anxiety refers to forms of anxiety distinctly related to autism, including idiosyncratic fears, fear relating to social confusion, special interest fears, and fears of change. A longitudinal analysis of amygdala development across early childhood (23) indicated that the amygdala was larger across childhood only in those with co-occurring DSM-specified anxiety. In contrast, children with autism-distinct anxiety presentations at 11 years of age had smaller right amygdala volume at age 3 and a slower trajectory of amygdala development, resulting in persistently smaller amygdala volume in middle childhood. This is consistent with our previous work (8), where we found that while a substantial subset of autistic children exhibited an increased rate of amygdala growth during early childhood (37–50 months of age), a small but meaningful subset also demonstrated slower-than-expected amygdala growth. This highlights the high degree of heterogeneity in both the behavioral presentation and the biology of autism as well as the need to consider subgroups of autistic children. Another important variable to consider is biological sex. Shen et al. report main effects of sex in amygdala development, but a relatively small number of autistic females in the sample (N=12) limits the ability to reliably detect sex differences. So, while there is little question that the development of the amygdala is altered in autism, how different patterns of amygdala development are related to social impairments, anxiety, or both remains unresolved.A second unresolved issue is the biology underlying the altered trajectory of development of the amygdala. As Shen et al. recount, there is postmortem stereological evidence that in autistic individuals the amygdala has a higher number of neurons in the early years and a lower number in adulthood (24). Whether there is an actual degenerative component to the lower cell number in later years is not possible to determine with available evidence. There is evidence from nonhuman primate studies indicating substantial plasticity of amygdala development that may be germane to an understanding of altered amygdala trajectory in autistic individuals. For example, it has been known for some time that the paralaminar nucleus of the amygdala harbors a large population of immature neurons (25–28). These appear to be the substrate for substantial morphological plasticity in the postnatal amygdala. In nonhuman primates that had undergone early lesions of the hippocampal formation, the number of mature neurons was 40% higher in the lateral and basal nuclei of the mature animals and 70% higher in the paralaminar nucleus. The paralaminar nucleus appeared to be repopulated with immature neurons, since the number was 40% higher in the adult amygdala of the neonatally lesioned animals. A fruitful area for future analysis of the postmortem human brain will be to determine whether the regulation of the paralaminar nucleus of the amygdala is particularly altered in ASD. Research on the nonhuman primate has also emphasized the complexity of the amygdala, which comprises no fewer than 13 subnuclei and cortical areas (29). MRI analysis of the autistic amygdala has not yet taken this complexity into consideration.The report by Shen et al. highlights the fact that alterations of amygdala development are certainly one prominent component of the neurophenotype of ASD, and, importantly, they are present by 12 months of age, well before behavioral diagnosis of ASD can reliably be made. However, it should not be expected that the amygdala will be involved in the same way across all autistic individuals. What differentiates those with and without amygdala alterations and how this maps onto both their core and co-occurring symptoms will be productive areas of future research. Since individuals with fragile X syndrome do not have clear volumetric alterations of amygdala development during infancy but nonetheless demonstrate substantial symptoms of anxiety (30), the underlying neurobiological alterations leading to similar behavioral phenotypes in different neurodevelopmental disorders may be quite diverse. In the end, the paper by Shen et al. emphasizes the value of longitudinal studies, particularly in infancy, prior to the behavioral diagnosis of autism, and of the benefits of the enormous effort put forward by the IBIS network of investigators.Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, the MIND Institute, University of California, Davis, Sacramento.Send correspondence to Dr. Amaral ([email protected]).Dr. Amaral has served on the scientific advisory boards of Axial Therapeutics and Stemina Biomarker Discovery.

Considering that neuroimaging changes in the hippocampus and default mode network (DMN) are promising important candidate biomarkers and have been included in the research criteria for the diagnosis of AD, it is hypothesized that atrophy and metabolic changes of the abovementioned regions could be evaluated concurrently to fully explore the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in AD. Twenty-three AD patients and Twenty-four age-, sex- and education level-matched normal controls underwent a clinical interview, a detailed neuropsychological assessment and a simultaneous 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET)/high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan on a hybrid GE SIGNA PET/MR scanner. Brain volume and glucose metabolism were examined in patients and controls to reveal group differences. Multiple linear regression models were employed to explore the relationship between multiple imaging features and cognitive performance in AD. The AD group had significantly reduced volume in the hippocampus and DMN regions (P < 0.001) relative to that of normal controls determined by using ROI analysis. Compared to normal controls, significantly decreased metabolism in the DMN (P < 0.001) was also found in AD patients, which still survived after controlling for gray matter atrophy (P < 0.001). These findings from ROI analysis were further confirmed by whole-brain confirmatory analysis (P < 0.001, FWE-corrected). Finally, multiple linear regression results showed that impairment of multiple cognitive tasks was significantly correlated with the combination of DMN hypometabolism and atrophy in the hippocampus and DMN regions. This study demonstrated that combining functional and structural features can better explain the cognitive decline of AD patients than unimodal FDG or brain volume changes alone. These findings may have important implications for understanding the neural mechanisms of cognitive decline in AD.",13,5,7228,7246,Internal medicine; Default mode network; Magnetic resonance imaging; Oncology; Effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance; Atrophy; Cognitive decline; Neuropsychological assessment; Neuroimaging; Brain size; Medicine,Alzheimer’s disease; default mode network; gray matter volume; hippocampus; hybrid PET/MR,Age Factors; Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging; Atrophy; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Case-Control Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnostic imaging; Female; Gray Matter/diagnostic imaging; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Sex Factors,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993730 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7993730 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33640881 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33640881/,http://dx.doi.org/10.18632/aging.202580,33640881,10.18632/aging.202580,3134408749,PMC7993730,1,000-208-153-403-138; 000-782-727-459-410; 002-684-940-593-743; 003-265-094-799-012; 005-502-648-894-679; 005-547-718-716-309; 005-861-030-105-775; 009-228-101-008-721; 010-137-699-510-119; 010-519-573-880-994; 012-562-870-259-631; 012-702-816-004-197; 013-170-529-510-187; 016-052-566-263-121; 016-294-058-685-338; 016-781-011-490-187; 016-797-435-642-910; 022-661-443-486-457; 022-988-712-445-94X; 023-108-298-837-689; 023-366-417-381-787; 024-949-659-876-740; 026-432-255-440-60X; 026-499-581-545-980; 026-744-790-713-553; 031-603-911-325-007; 032-506-102-161-526; 033-119-688-018-001; 034-542-868-749-789; 035-464-704-225-933; 035-563-768-680-947; 036-991-272-640-295; 041-159-816-865-579; 041-923-534-648-964; 044-686-824-668-448; 050-864-904-994-557; 051-063-828-201-047; 052-690-172-487-095; 053-440-568-338-816; 055-923-697-000-984; 055-943-333-143-624; 057-017-155-318-363; 057-173-679-079-863; 059-396-491-529-368; 059-964-163-231-020; 062-061-819-555-708; 062-967-934-632-108; 067-535-394-341-264; 071-364-569-496-032; 074-805-234-343-827; 077-273-307-091-97X; 084-788-298-077-16X; 086-627-908-967-713; 088-597-710-235-734; 090-389-990-695-73X; 094-776-753-813-638; 099-669-724-213-834; 109-660-031-077-622; 109-960-306-196-036; 110-078-759-679-61X; 113-973-431-964-847; 119-631-730-614-212,17,true,cc-by,gold

Supervised machine learning approaches classifying neurodegenerative diseases require diagnostic-labels for each sample. However, it can be difficult to obtain expert labels for a large amount of data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers an alternative for training machine learning models without data-labels. We investigated if the SSL models can applied to distinguish between different neurodegenerative disorders in an interpretable manner. Our method comprises a feature extractor and a downstream classification head. A deep convolutional neural network trained in a contrastive self-supervised way serves as the feature extractor, learning latent representation, while the classifier head is a single-layer perceptron. We used N=2694 T1-weighted MRI scans from four data cohorts: two ADNI datasets, AIBL and FTLDNI, including cognitively normal controls (CN), cases with prodromal and clinical AD, as well as FTLD cases differentiated into its sub-types. Our results showed that the feature extractor trained in a self-supervised way provides generalizable and robust representations for the downstream classification. For AD vs. CN, our model achieves 82% balanced accuracy on the test subset and 80% on an independent holdout dataset. Similarly, the Behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (BV) vs. CN model attains an 88% balanced accuracy on the test subset. The average feature attribution heatmaps obtained by the Integrated Gradient method highlighted hallmark regions, i.e., temporal gray matter atrophy for AD, and insular atrophy for BV. In conclusion, our models perform comparably to state-of-the-art supervised deep learning approaches. This suggests that the SSL methodology can successfully make use of unannotated neuroimaging datasets as training data while remaining robust and interpretable.",,,,,Psychology; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Neuroscience; Natural language processing,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.03.24309882,39006425,10.1101/2024.07.03.24309882,,PMC11245060,0,004-269-574-716-057; 004-345-147-977-836; 004-624-717-245-461; 005-422-683-467-883; 005-771-117-987-281; 009-941-473-795-942; 010-795-004-186-442; 012-078-551-223-098; 012-292-831-894-686; 013-091-033-191-80X; 020-233-013-143-936; 021-771-046-587-546; 022-600-506-808-814; 024-636-616-666-21X; 024-943-065-856-606; 027-013-518-283-248; 032-515-660-820-80X; 034-874-082-280-49X; 041-681-348-360-896; 042-543-256-179-329; 051-284-518-564-941; 055-785-345-644-628; 058-075-607-292-806; 065-365-390-151-189; 068-347-094-499-391; 076-934-933-153-890; 093-503-605-952-257; 104-208-613-793-423; 109-047-557-910-425; 111-425-476-505-601; 114-324-845-021-626; 114-568-253-759-767; 121-760-301-943-344; 125-733-448-743-138; 130-850-636-760-844; 131-212-117-868-714; 133-505-488-084-582; 139-552-118-652-140; 140-811-458-058-788; 144-015-058-699-55X; 148-003-276-001-508; 151-213-994-396-341; 152-877-910-658-964; 155-816-413-999-469; 162-300-681-613-979; 192-641-933-193-338; 196-596-582-820-605,0,true,,unknown

Montine; Jeffrey Kaye,"Background: Autopsy series have shown that some elderly people remain with normal cognitive function during life despite having high burdens of pathologic lesions associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) at death. Understanding why these individuals show no cognitive decline, despite high AD pathologic burdens, may be key to discovery of neuroprotective mechanisms. Methods: A total of 36 subjects who on autopsy had Braak stage V or VI and moderate or frequent neuritic plaque scores based on Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer9s Disease (CERAD) standards were included. Twelve had normal cognitive function and 24 a diagnosis of AD before death. Demographic characteristics, clinical and pathologic data, as well as antemortem brain volumes were compared between the groups. Results: In multiple regression analysis, antemortem hippocampal and total brain volumes were significantly larger in the group with normal cognitive function after adjusting for gender, age at MRI, time from MRI to death, Braak stage, CERAD neuritic plaque score, and overall presence of vascular disease. Conclusion: Larger brain and hippocampal volumes were associated with preserved cognitive function during life despite a high burden of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologic lesions at death. A better understanding of processes that lead to preservation of brain volume may provide important clues for the discovery of mechanisms that protect the elderly from AD.

Methods:The volumetric measurements of the total brain volume,caudate,putamen,globus pallidus,substantia nigra in PD patients and the controls were performed on a 3.0T MR scanner. The patients underwent the assessment of the sub scale Ⅱ,Ⅲ and Ⅴ of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale(UPDRS).Correlation analysis was made between the volumetric measurements and UPDRS assessment.Results:Compared to controls,the early stage PD patients and late stage PD patients had smaller volume of the putamen which decreased respectively 12.5%(P=0.004) and 26.5%(P0.001). The late stage PD patients had even smaller volume of the putamen 16%(P=0.002) than the early stage ones. The volume of the globus palldus in the late stage PD patients decreased 19.2%(P=0.023),compared to controls. The volume of the putamen of PD patients was negatively correlated with the HY range(r=-0.741,P0.001).

Artificial intelligence in neuroradiology is used to reduce the acquisition time, for automatic 3D reconstruction of sequences, reduction of artifacts given by the movement of patients and for improving image quality. These softwares can also segment the cerebral parenchyma in the volume of cerebrospinal fluid, white matter and gray matter, and these data can be compared to monitor the evolution or stagnation of certain pathologies. The most common pathologies in which magnetic resonance imaging is used are multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, fronto-temporal dementia, focal epilepsy and parkinsonism. According to the latest studies, artificial intelligence algorithms can segment brain tumors, can detect areas of microhemorrhages, can approximate the affected brain volume in case of strokes and can predict their general prognosis.

Post-mortem studies have reported a loss of neurons in the mammillary bodies but there are also reports of increased mammillary body volume. The findings from in vivo MRI studies have also been mixed, but studies have typically only involved small sample sizes. To address this, we acquired mammillary body volumes from the open-source COBRE dataset, where we were able to manually measure the mammillary bodies in 72 individuals with a schizophrenia diagnosis and 74 controls. Participant age ranged from 18 to 65. We found the mammillary bodies to be smaller in the patient group, across both hemispheres, after accounting for the effects of total brain volume and gender. Hippocampal volumes, but not subiculum or total grey matter volumes, were also significantly lower in patients. Given the importance of the mammillary bodies for both memory and anxiety, this atrophy could contribute to the symptomology in schizophrenia.",9,1,48,,Mammillary body; Subiculum; Thalamus; Psychology; Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming); Neuroscience; Hippocampus; Temporal lobe; Psychiatry; Dentate gyrus; Epilepsy,,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; NCRR NIH HHS (P20 RR021938) United States,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-023-00376-7.pdf https://doi.org/10.1038/s41537-023-00376-7 https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/449691/s41537_023_00376_7.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/449691,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41537-023-00376-7,37528127,10.1038/s41537-023-00376-7,,PMC10394056,0,002-612-143-267-870; 003-066-546-053-333; 004-077-593-570-093; 011-820-183-933-551; 018-427-974-453-988; 019-921-794-446-764; 020-718-325-124-828; 023-029-037-321-777; 029-910-535-416-172; 032-996-335-987-024; 034-122-594-098-948; 035-408-710-879-945; 035-640-129-845-975; 035-988-621-351-755; 037-216-442-125-069; 037-522-962-131-265; 039-129-283-407-84X; 040-055-977-826-615; 042-419-345-420-809; 043-586-740-451-183; 044-596-244-333-36X; 044-671-558-785-067; 045-256-584-237-572; 052-027-841-835-253; 064-272-541-364-239; 070-183-480-071-063; 073-891-659-381-391; 074-293-883-997-998; 086-767-560-168-332; 090-812-504-226-360; 092-945-483-843-213; 098-950-047-388-773; 101-171-276-460-71X; 102-390-037-622-095; 103-402-499-602-648; 116-948-187-219-160; 131-377-409-991-074; 149-043-457-163-541,4,true,cc-by,gold

Sibilla; Giorgio Bono; Giovanni Augusto Carlesimo; Elena Sinforiani; A. Martelli,"The aim of the present study was to assess selective atrophy of the temporal lobe and amygdala in the early stages of Alzheimer dementia (AD). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements and the presence of highsignal lesions (HSL) were analysed in 31 patients with mild to moderate probable AD and 22 controls. In the AD group, MRI findings were compared with cognitive variables and specific features of memory functions. Alzheimer patients showed a significant reduction in volumetric measurement compared with controls in the total volume (P < 0.01), temporal lobe (P < 0.01) and amygdala (P < 0.05). The temporal lobe/brain volume ratio was also significantly reduced in AD subjects (P < 0.05). Atrophy of temporal structures was significantly related to the degree of episodic and semantic memory impairment according to a material-specific effect. No significant correlations between amygdala and cognitive variables were found. The results of our study confirm the usefulness of measures of temporal lobe atrophy assessed with MRI in the diagnosis of AD. In contrast, HSL are relatively common in AD patients (12/31 cases) and were not related to volumetric findings, severity of dementia or functional disability.",245,8,525,530,Internal medicine; Pathology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Psychology; Cardiology; Semantic memory; Neuropsychological test; Dementia; Temporal lobe; Atrophy; Alzheimer's disease; Brain size,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease/complications; Amygdala/pathology; Atrophy/diagnosis; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory Disorders/diagnosis; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Temporal Lobe/pathology",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9747916 https://core.ac.uk/display/53846479 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs004150050237 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/9747916 https://moh-it.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/the-role-of-morpho-volumetric-and-memory-correlations-in-the-diag https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s004150050237 http://art.torvergata.it/handle/2108/66468,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004150050237,9747916,10.1007/s004150050237,2039452146,,0,007-420-184-921-491; 009-773-242-304-237; 020-798-450-711-581; 022-988-712-445-94X; 024-359-804-050-081; 028-173-692-743-392; 038-946-503-880-051; 046-393-930-104-420; 048-536-112-681-339; 051-118-999-267-96X; 053-878-646-698-611; 066-608-905-207-154; 109-424-954-675-626; 120-229-920-774-487; 126-897-897-109-316; 145-050-694-943-349,13,true,,green

The features have to accurately capture main AD-related variations of anatomical brain structures, such as, e.g., ventricles size, hippocampus shape, cortical thickness, and brain volume. This paper proposes to predict the AD with a deep 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), which can learn generic features capturing AD biomarkers and adapt to different domain datasets. The 3D-CNN is built upon a 3D convolutional autoencoder, which is pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in structural brain MRI scans. Fully connected upper layers of the 3D-CNN are then fine-tuned for each task-specific AD classification. Experiments on the \emph{ADNI} MRI dataset with no skull-stripping preprocessing have shown our 3D-CNN outperforms several conventional classifiers by accuracy and robustness. Abilities of the 3D-CNN to generalize the features learnt and adapt to other domains have been validated on the \emph{CADDementia} dataset.",,,,,Convolutional neural network; Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Autoencoder; Pattern recognition (psychology); Preprocessor; Deep learning; Voxel; Robustness (evolution); Biochemistry; Chemistry; Gene,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00556,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1607.00556,,10.48550/arxiv.1607.00556,,,0,,1,true,other-oa,green

This can be used to turn classification problems from longitudinal settings into simpler image classification problems, allowing for the application of newer deep learning methods on longitudinal measurements. Our approach is applicable to situations with balanced or imbalanced longitudinal data sets, and where there are missing data at some time points. To evaluate our approach, we apply it to an important and challenging task: the prediction of dementia from brain volume trajectories derived from longitudinal MRI. We construct an ensemble of convolutional neural network models to classify two groups of subjects: those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment at all examinations (stable MCI) versus those starting out as MCI but later converting to Alzheimer’s disease (converted AD). Models were trained on image representations derived from N = 736 subjects sourced from the ADNI database (471/265 sMCI/cAD). We obtained an accuracy of a resulting ensemble model of 76%, measured on an independent test set. Our approach is simple and easy to apply but competitive (in terms of accuracy) with results reported in other machine learning approaches with similar classification on comparable tasks. This indicates that our approach can lead to useful representations of longitudinal data.</jats:p>",,,,,Artificial intelligence; Construct (python library); Pattern recognition (psychology); Computer science; Convolutional neural network; Longitudinal study; Set (abstract data type); Machine learning; Longitudinal data; Dementia; Data set; Data mining; Mathematics; Statistics; Disease; Pathology; Medicine; Programming language,,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1541040/latest.pdf https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1541040/v1,http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1541040/v1,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-1541040/v1,,,0,,0,true,cc-by,green

Irrespective of diagnosis and intervention, associations between brain changes and cardiorespiratory fitness improvement were examined. Sixty-three schizophrenia patients and fifty-five healthy controls participated in this randomised controlled trial. Global brain volumes, hippocampal volume, and cortical thickness were estimated from 3-Tesla MRI scans. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed with a cardiopulmonary ergometer test. Subjects were assigned exercise therapy or occupational therapy (patients) and exercise therapy or life-as-usual (healthy controls) for six months 2h weekly. Exercise therapy effects were analysed for subjects who were compliant at least 50% of sessions offered. Significantly smaller baseline cerebral (grey) matter, and larger third ventricle volumes, and thinner cortex in most areas of the brain were found in patients versus controls. Exercise therapy did not affect global brain and hippocampal volume or cortical thickness in patients and controls. Cardiorespiratory fitness improvement was related to increased cerebral matter volume and lateral and third ventricle volume decrease in patients and to thickening in the left hemisphere in large areas of the frontal, temporal and cingulate cortex irrespective of diagnosis. One to 2h of exercise therapy did not elicit significant brain volume changes in patients or controls. However, cardiorespiratory fitness improvement attenuated brain volume changes in schizophrenia patients and increased thickness in large areas of the left cortex in both schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.",23,7,675,685,Cardiorespiratory fitness; Internal medicine; Psychology; Cardiology; Physical fitness; Physical therapy; Cortex (anatomy); Third ventricle; Cingulate cortex; Brain size; Schizophrenia; Lateralization of brain function,,Adolescent; Adult; Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use; Brain/pathology; Case-Control Studies; Cerebral Cortex/pathology; Exercise Test; Exercise Therapy; Female; Hippocampus/pathology; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Occupational Therapy; Physical Fitness; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Schizophrenia/drug therapy,Antipsychotic Agents,,https://core.ac.uk/display/82083187 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22981376 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924977X1200226X https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/exercise-therapy-cardiorespiratory-fitness-and-their-effect-on-br https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22981376/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22981376 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924977X1200226X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2012.08.008,22981376,10.1016/j.euroneuro.2012.08.008,2030455633,,0,000-923-757-971-665; 001-460-788-851-891; 002-009-406-588-507; 003-006-047-960-831; 003-312-890-808-724; 003-468-746-679-623; 005-676-949-416-646; 006-472-848-818-015; 007-181-166-479-526; 007-931-940-410-895; 008-764-997-763-756; 008-973-409-571-450; 012-998-325-766-248; 013-373-698-715-212; 014-363-729-097-70X; 016-553-465-095-865; 019-684-864-750-678; 020-081-317-803-243; 020-394-341-495-452; 021-192-134-008-480; 021-516-464-437-120; 023-193-875-471-189; 025-878-660-850-32X; 029-138-590-751-634; 030-360-030-637-270; 033-908-332-743-976; 034-194-799-337-490; 034-258-423-336-705; 034-552-646-953-927; 035-123-923-952-991; 041-408-325-415-308; 044-124-669-630-436; 044-299-608-584-354; 052-270-331-447-314; 052-982-098-697-346; 056-358-415-332-305; 057-385-344-024-240; 060-540-915-565-610; 061-170-893-361-027; 066-175-733-598-986; 068-467-664-448-884; 068-865-428-808-888; 069-167-892-439-631; 070-891-535-551-88X; 074-144-368-229-477; 078-172-744-604-511; 087-709-452-850-896; 089-014-295-999-217; 089-161-519-736-812; 090-274-138-552-565; 090-812-504-226-360; 091-388-073-208-625; 094-454-887-529-446; 098-284-810-712-732; 101-474-894-739-53X; 108-083-853-256-132; 111-158-203-082-451; 116-998-937-586-791; 127-689-947-991-977; 132-733-193-017-655; 149-566-161-779-411,128,true,implied-oa,hybrid

Studies of the neurobiology of schizophrenia have identified pathological changes and mechanisms in the brain associated with vulnerability and the manifest illness ( 3 ). Research reveals that neuropathological brain changes and information-processing deficits in schizophrenia are mild preceding the onset of symptoms but worsen after acute illness and often progress with subsequent clinical episodes. These findings imply irreversible loss of brain volume and deterioration of mental functions. At the same time, a more hopeful view of the course of illness emerges from the recovery movement, which emphasizes developing a meaningful life beyond illness, and this view is supported by long-term outcome studies, which consistently show heterogeneity, with many patients improving and in some cases achieving substantial remission of illness ( 4 , 5 ). Although these two models may seem contradictory, the Surgeon General's report on mental health ( 5 ) and the report of the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health ( 6 ) attempt to bridge them. Indeed, the report of the New Freedom Commission ( 6 ), intended to be a roadmap for the mental health system, states that recovery is the ""single most important goal"" of people served by the mental health system and that we should ""accelerate research to promote recovery."" In this article, we suggest a working definition of recovery that may facilitate communication and permit a research-based synthesis of the two models. Following a brief historical overview of models for understanding schizophrenia, we discuss recent research on course and treatment in relation to recovery. Historical background Both neuroscience and recovery models of schizophrenia have deep historical roots. In the original conceptualization of dementia praecox by Kraepelin ( 7 ), the illness was seen as progressive and deteriorating. This pessimistic view was reinforced for many years by the limitations of existing treatments ( 8 ) and recently by research on brain abnormalities and neurodevelopmental theories of schizophrenia (summarized below). The presumption of a deteriorating course and structural brain abnormalities has sometimes fostered an attitude of therapeutic nihilism ( 9 ). The neurodevelopmental theory postulates that etiologic and pathogenic factors occur long before the onset of the illness (probably in gestation), disrupt the course of normal neural development, and produce alterations of specific neural circuits that confer vulnerability and ultimately lead to biological and psychosocial malfunction ( 10 , 11 , 12 ). According to this view, once the neurodevelopmental diathesis of schizophrenia has been established, the illness runs an inexorable course. Kraepelin's pessimistic view and circular reasoning (that is, course was used to determine diagnosis) were challenged by Bleuler ( 13 ), who observed that patients with apparent dementia praecox constituted a heterogeneous ""group of schizophrenias"" with highly variable outcomes. He noted that some patients' symptoms remitted substantially or even completely, with return to normal functioning, and that the modal course was one of eventual improvement, which he termed ""healing with scarring."" Since Bleuler's early observations, the evidence from numerous long-term follow-up studies has supported this heterogeneity, the capacity for symptomatic remission and functional improvement early in the course of the illness, and also, though less completely, improvements in later life ( 14 , 15 , 16 ). Mental health advocates have embraced the longitudinal research as evidence of the potential for recovery. Defining recovery Much of the tension between neuroscientists' emphasis on brain pathologies and mental health advocates' emphasis on recovery appears to arise from the lack of definitional clarity. Recovery has been defined in literally dozens of ways ( 17 ). Neuroscientists, on the one hand, often assume that recovery connotes the complete absence of disease or a cure. Even current studies of outcome and recovery tend to emphasize returns to normal function ( 8 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ). Advocates, on the other hand, often use recovery to describe a process of managing one's mental illness, moving beyond its devastating psychological effects, and pursuing a personally meaningful life in the community ( 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 ). This latter meaning involves hope, motivation, personal responsibility, the pursuit of individual goals, and participation in community life, but not necessarily the absence of symptoms. Recovery in this more complex sense implies certain types of outcomes and treatments but is also connected to civil rights, stigma, self-help, opportunities, and other community concepts that are much broader than usual definitions of illness and level of functions of the health care system. Davidson and colleagues ( 31 ) offered the simple but useful clarification that neuroscientists are describing recovery ""from"" illness, which implies cure, whereas advocates are describing recovery ""in"" illness (that is, being ""in recovery""), which refers to moving ahead with one's life, often despite persistent symptoms. Given the protean definitions of recovery and the potential for miscommunication, how can we understand and discuss the links between science and recovery? One possible solution, which we do not endorse, would be to avoid the term recovery entirely as another unhelpful piece of mental health jargon. This path would ignore the power and value of the term for consumers and providers and would fail to respond to the New Freedom Commission's recognition of the importance of recovery and its call for research on this concept. We therefore propose an alternative path of definitional specificity and consistency based on using qualifying terms for recovery. Because the meaning of recovery lacks precision (and thus promotes ambiguity and confusion), we propose using standard qualifiers—for example, ""recovery of cognitive functioning"" or ""recovery of vocational functioning""—to signify improvements in specific areas. The danger remains that some will read recovery as implying complete cure, but we endorse the current emphasis on improvement, which realistically emphasizes states of partial cure. The emphasis on a range of improvements in specific areas should allow us to communicate more clearly regarding the current findings and goals of research. We also acknowledge that civil rights, stigma, housing, vocational opportunities, and other community issues are relevant to the recovery movement and extremely important to those with disabilities but are generally outside the scope of the psychiatric research reviewed here.Natural history of schizophrenia and recovery Schizophrenia is a complex brain disorder that spans the life course ( Figure 1 ). Although the etiology is uncertain, current evidence indicates that polygenic factors combine with a variety of environmental insults—including intrauterine stressors (for example, malnutrition and infection), birth complications, and postnatal factors (for example, psychoactive drug use)—to influence and perturb neurodevelopment and enhance the vulnerability to develop the heterogeneous disorder that we call schizophrenia ( 3 ). Although the disorder has been defined for the past century primarily in terms of psychotic symptoms, schizophrenia more recently has been characterized in terms of brain abnormalities and other symptom dimensions, such as negative symptoms and impairments in neurocognitive functioning in addition to psychosis ( 9 , 32 ). Figure 1 Course of illness and potential effects of interventions in schizophreniaNeurobiology The evidence for neurobiological abnormalities underlying schizophrenia is robust. Several susceptibility genes for schizophrenia have been identified and replicated, with evidence rapidly emerging of the functional significance of allelic variation, mutations, and copy number variation ( 33 , 34 ). These genes give rise to the (intermediate) phenotype, or observable aspects, of the illness ( 35 , 36 ). Neuroimaging research has demonstrated decreased gray matter volume in the cerebral cortex, reduced volumes of the hippocampus and thalamus, and enlarged lateral and third ventricles and subarachnoid space ( 37 , 38 , 39 ). Studies of brain function using neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and cognitive tests have also consistently found evidence of hypofunctioning in specific tasks mediated by the frontal and temporal lobes ( 40 ) and of diminished perfusion or activation on measures of positron-emission tomography or functional magnetic resonance imaging ( 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 ). At the same time, studies of sensory gating among patients with schizophrenia show deficiencies in the normal inhibitory mechanisms that help to manage modulation of various sensory inputs ( 47 , 48 , 49 ). Milder forms of these biological abnormalities appear to be present at the onset of overt psychotic illness and may be present premorbidly, with areas of cognitive dysfunction carrying implications for brain localization, as well as for greater specificity for cognitive remediation interventions ( 50 ). Progressive structural pathology may occur with additional psychotic episodes, at least for a subgroup of patients ( 51 ), leading to the current hypothesis that active psychosis can be neurotoxic ( 9 ). Some patients clearly demonstrate further deterioration of brain structure and cognitive function over time ( 52 ). The natural age-dependent attrition of dopamine activity may also explain why positive symptoms tend to decrease over time and in later life ( 53 ). Importantly, all of these studies show a range of findings from little or no differences through extreme abnormalities relative to persons without the disorder. The large number of genes and types of environmental insults involved in etiology almost certainly underlie the extreme heterogeneity of brain abnormalities and of vulnerabilities, although these relationships are not yet well understood.Psychotic symptoms Many people experience psychotic symptoms (for example, in relation to drug use or trauma), but only a small proportion experience severe disturbances that endure for months and thus meet the criteria for schizophrenia ( 54 ). Although a substantial proportion of individuals experience a full remission of psychotic symptoms, few fully recover without recurrences. It is unclear if this is due to the recurrent and progressive nature of the illness, to the limitations of our treatments, or to problems with access to and delivery of clinical care. On the other hand, only a minority of patients fail to respond to treatment and remain severely psychotic for many years after their first episode. Although the early phase of illness is characterized by positive symptoms of psychosis, each successive episode of psychosis may bring less resolution of positive symptoms and an increasing prominence of negative symptoms, which often become enduring. Positive symptoms tend to diminish in intensity in the fifth and sixth decades of life ( 53 , 55 ). Cognitive symptoms There is increasing recognition that cognitive symptoms (also termed neuropsychological or neurocognitive deficits related to abnormalities in perception and information processing) constitute a more persistent dimension of the illness and one that more directly and permanently limits functioning ( 32 , 56 , 57 ). Subtle cognitive and academic performance differences between individuals who do not develop schizophrenia and future schizophrenia patients emerge in childhood and precede the onset of formal signs of the illness, but these are not outside the normal range ( 58 , 59 , 60 ). At the time of the first psychotic episode, most patients appear to sustain a further decrement in cognitive functioning ( 61 ). There is little or no evidence for natural improvements in cognitive symptoms over time, and some elderly patients may gradually worsen over time ( 52 ). Psychosocial functioning Functional behaviors, such as living independently in the community, working competitively, and developing social and intimate relationships, have been studied for at least a century with several consistent findings. First, functional capacity is highly variable among persons with schizophrenia, but it shows some continuity over time ( 13 , 62 , 63 ). Some people have premorbid functioning in the normal range, whereas others show prolonged poor levels of function or severe deterioration in functioning before the onset of overt illness; these differences were the basis for the theory of good and poor prognosis and the theory of process and nonprocess schizophrenia ( 64 ) and more recently for concepts of deficit and nondeficit schizophrenia ( 56 , 65 ). Second, for persons with schizophrenia, functioning in adult roles is strongly affected by environmental opportunities, supports, stimulation, and stigma. Stigma works its ill effects in ways that are hard to quantify, but it produces a major impact on opportunities for normative life and for self-esteem and morale. During the era of long-term hospitalization, for example, patients with schizophrenia experienced profound atrophy of social, vocational, and basic living skills as a result of prolonged isolation and exposure to neglectful, stultifying conditions ( 66 , 67 ), which as iatrogenic effects may have reinforced false beliefs about intrinsic deterioration. Conversely, affording people opportunities to develop in social and vocational ways engenders optimism and better functioning ( 68 , 69 ). International studies by the World Health Organization show that patients with schizophrenia experience better functional outcomes in agrarian societies or developing economies with greater family and social supports, simpler vocational roles, and less stigma regarding the illness ( 70 ). Third, functional performance in schizophrenia has a highly variable course, with substantial restoration of psychosocial functioning after initial episodes, increasing deterioration following subsequent episodes, and the potential for some degree of functional improvement in later life ( 69 ). The evidence that many people with schizophrenia improve in social and vocational functioning over time is counterbalanced by the evidence that many others suffer sustained disability, high rates of institutionalization in nursing homes, and excessive medical morbidity and mortality ( 71 , 72 , 73 ). In the United States, people with schizophrenia die approximately 25 years earlier than others in the general population, and the majority of older people with schizophrenia are not living independently in the community. The magnitude of effects has been small to moderate from a host of variables thought to influence behavioral function in schizophrenia, including gender, birth trauma, age at onset, mode of onset, premorbid adjustment, intelligence, severity of symptoms, neurocognitive deficits, and severity of abnormal brain morphology ( 62 , 63 , 74 , 75 , 76 , 77 ). However, recent research shows that cognitive impairments probably have the strongest associations with functional outcomes ( 32 , 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 ) and predict an estimated 40% of the variance ( 83 ), far more than any other domain ( 32 ). Quality of life Quality of life encompasses many of the same concepts as current multifaceted views of recovery ( 84 ). Quality of life refers to the nonillness aspects of the person's life and generally includes subjective views of physical health status, functional ability, psychological status and well-being, social interactions, and economic status ( 85 ). In mental health research, quality-of-life measures also address satisfaction with life, functioning in daily activities and social roles, personal preferences regarding goals, living conditions, safety, environmental restrictions, finances, and opportunities ( 84 , 86 , 87 , 88 , 89 ). Although quality of life has many of the same problems of nonspecificity as the concept of recovery, it offers the advantages of clear communication and harmony with other areas of medicine faced with the same challenges. Mental health research shows that patients with schizophrenia report worse quality of life than the general population and than those with physical illnesses; that younger, female, married, and less educated patients report higher quality of life; that length of illness correlates with lower quality of life; and that more symptoms, especially negative and cognitive symptoms, are related to lower quality of life ( 90 ). In general, subjective quality of life is related to the discrepancy between circumstances and expectations, which probably explains the inverse relationship with education. Many psychological constructs, such as self-esteem and self-efficacy, are considered to be mediating variables in models of quality of life ( 89 ). Self-agency The concept of recovery clearly extends beyond quality of life to encompass a process of assuming self-agency by developing hope, taking responsibility for one's life, participating actively in one's treatment, managing one's illness, and defining and pursuing personally meaningful goals. These issues have been described extensively in the recovery literature ( 26 , 27 , 91 , 92 , 93 , 94 ). Intervention research and recoveryRecovery of biological functions Several lines of evidence are beginning to show that biological functions in the brain can improve with treatment among adults with schizophrenia. Recent studies of nicotinic agonists have been reported to improve sensory gating ( 95 ), and dopamine agonists have been found to enhance frontal cortical blood flow and metabolism ( 96 ). In addition, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and some antipsychotics have been found to promote growth in neural and glial cells ( 97 , 98 , 99 , 100 ). Moreover, clinical studies have shown that administration of selective mood stabilizers (for example, lithium) and antipsychotics (for example, clozapine-like second-generation drugs) can attenuate the loss or increase the volume of brain gray matter ( 101 , 102 , 103 ). Recent research also suggests that at the cellular level medications improve neurochemical function and that learning-based interventions, such as cognitive training, may also improve neural connectivity ( 104 ). Recovery from psychosis Interventions during the early phase of psychosis aim to eliminate symptoms completely (full remission) and prevent future episodes of psychosis. For the majority of first-episode patients, antipsychotic medications and evidence-based psychosocial treatments can achieve full or substantial remission of positive symptoms ( 105 ). Elimination of negative symptoms is much less clear. Combinations of current medications and psychosocial interventions can prevent future episodes of psychosis in most cases, but only if patients continue to receive treatment. Approximately 90% of patients will have at least one psychotic relapse within five years ( 106 ), partially because of high attrition rates from treatment, failure to implement evidence-based interventions, and the limitations of available therapeutics. In general, medications are less effective for patients with chronic schizophrenia than for those with first-episode or early-stage schizophrenia. Combining psychosocial interventions (such as assertive community treatment, family psychoeducation, adherence interventions, social skills training, and relapse prevention techniques) with medications has an additive effect on relapse prevention ( 107 , 108 , 109 , 110 , 111 ). Cognitive-behavioral interventions can also reduce the functional impact of residual positive psychotic symptoms, as well as diminish negative symptoms ( 109 , 112 ). The combination of optimal psychosocial and pharmacological intervention for management of symptoms has been termed ""illness management and recovery"" ( 109 ). Recovery of cognitive functions Cognitive symptoms are rarely, if ever, eliminated when present at the onset of illness and the initial episode of psychosis. Although researchers have just started to target cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia, initial studies suggest that specific cognitive symptoms can be reduced (not eliminated) by second-generation antipsychotic medications ( 113 , 114 ), by cognitive retraining ( 115 , 116 , 117 , 118 ), and perhaps by supportive psychotherapy ( 110 ). Improvements in existing cognitive symptoms, although modest, may at some point become sufficient to improve more complex functional behaviors, such as social, educational, and vocational functioning ( 110 , 115 , 119 , 120 , 121 ). Functional magnetic resonance imaging data suggest that cognitive rehabilitation programs may even change the way the brain processes information ( 116 ). Improvements in cognition lead to immediate benefits, such as increased learning potential ( 83 ), social cognition ( 122 ), and functional capacity ( 123 , 124 , 125 ); longer-term effects on cognitive functions remain to be demonstrated. Recovery of functional capacity Psychiatric rehabilitation targets specific behavioral functions, such as independent living, competitive employment, education, family relationships, and social relationships ( 107 , 126 , 127 ). Effective interventions include skills training, psychoeducation, cognitive-behavioral therapies, cognitive enhancement therapies, and a variety of supports within and around normative community settings ( 5 , 6 , 121 , 128 , 129 , 130 ). Medications alone do not have a direct impact on behavioral functional performance but may facilitate participation in psychiatric rehabilitation ( 131 ). Research shows that independent living is a realistic goal for the great majority of individuals with schizophrenia. Supported housing and ""housing first"" approaches have demonstrated that most persons with schizophrenia (over 90%) can live in independent housing, without requiring stepwise progression through a continuum of group homes and without requiring participation in mental health treatment, provided they have supports ( 132 , 133 ). This capacity for independent community living includes individuals who are chronically homeless and mentally ill. For the small minority of patients with schizophrenia who cannot live independently, substance abuse and comorbid medical conditions, rather than mental illness, seem to be the critical barriers ( 134 , 135 ). Competitive employment and education in routine community settings also appear to be realistic and beneficial goals for most people with schizophrenia. Supported employment, which provides supports for finding jobs that match persons' interests and for maintaining employment, has robust empirical support ( 128 , 136 , 137 ). Supported employment is also effective for patients with severe disabilities and for those with comorbid conditions ( 128 ). Although 70% or more of participants in supported employment can achieve competitive employment, nearly all work part-time, and very few people entirely stop receiving disability payments ( 128 ). Limitations in the success of supported employment appear to be due to some combination of cognitive deficits and disincentives in the insurance and benefits systems ( 138 , 139 ). For example, patients who are working full-time can lose their health insurance and not be able to obtain insurance through employment. Supported education has received minimal research attention compared with supported employment, but it follows the same principles, uses similar techniques, and is often combined with supported employment ( 140 ). Helping people with schizophrenia return to work or school early in the course of illness, rather than after disability has been established for years, appears to be even more effective ( 141 , 142 ). The research on improving social relationships is considerably more complicated. Social skills training helps to improve specific social behaviors among patients with schizophrenia, and some transfer of these skills occurs from the training setting to patients' day-to-day lives ( 143 , 144 ). Nevertheless, after more than 40 years of research, social skills training remains controversial because the magnitude of effects on social performance behaviors in routine community settings remains uncertain. Recent efforts to include in vivo practice and to involve natural supports in reinforcing social skills are promising ( 145 , 146 ). Although many other approaches to helping people with schizophrenia achieve their social goals are commonly used and show promise (for example, consumer-run social programs, supported socialization, recovery centers, and clubhouses), they have not been studied rigorously ( 147 ). One area of social performance that has been studied separately is family relationships.

Barker; Guido Gonzalez; Nicolas Crossley; Matthew J. Kempton,"Background: The absence of markers for ante-mortem diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) results in this disorder’s being commonly mistaken for other conditions, such as idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). Such mistakes occur particularly in the initial stages, when ‘plus syndrome’ has not yet clinically emerged. Objective. To investigate global brain volume and tissue loss in patients with PSP relative to patients with IPD and healthy controls and correlations between clinical parameters and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived brain volume estimates. Methods: T1-weighted images were obtained from three groups of Chilean Latin American adults: 21 patients with IPD, 18 patients with PSP and 14 healthy controls. We used Structural Imaging Evaluation with Normalization of Atrophy (SIENAX) to assess white matter, gray matter and whole-brain volumes (normalized to cranial volume). Imaging data were used to analyze putative correlations with the clinical status of PSP and IPD patients using the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale Part III, Hoehn and Yahr, the Clinical Global Impression for Disease Severity Scale and the Frontal Assessment Battery. Results: PSP patients had significantly lower whole brain volume than both IPD patients and controls. Whole brain volume reduction in PSP patients was primarily attributable to gray matter volume reduction. We found a significant correlation between brain volume reduction and clinical status in the PSP group. Conclusions: At the group level, whole brain and gray matter volumes differentiated patients with PSP from patients with IPD. There was also significant clinical-imaging correlations with motor disturbances in PSP.",8,,218,218,Internal medicine; Pathology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Psychology; Cardiology; Clinical Global Impression; Progressive supranuclear palsy; Disease; Atrophy; White matter; Brain size; Rating scale,SIENA; SIENAX; idiopathic Parkinson’s disease; progressive supranuclear palsy; whole brain atrophy state,,,Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico,https://core.ac.uk/display/74475885 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00218/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27679572 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5020070 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00218/full https://repositorio.uchile.cl/handle/2250/142705 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00218/pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/77064563.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00218,27679572,10.3389/fnagi.2016.00218,2519271600,PMC5020070,0,002-664-604-930-52X; 007-796-760-166-224; 013-450-462-281-207; 014-403-137-404-343; 018-494-451-435-182; 021-187-714-295-950; 021-677-349-660-383; 021-939-535-113-92X; 022-894-822-051-67X; 025-449-259-263-318; 031-136-752-436-374; 034-807-679-511-385; 036-650-044-895-215; 036-827-819-206-27X; 041-482-768-417-973; 045-347-387-567-293; 050-206-216-825-827; 054-054-915-872-951; 055-901-263-372-345; 058-334-151-740-968; 067-660-641-382-18X; 071-757-099-263-177; 075-200-589-377-545; 076-229-497-315-270; 091-611-216-732-053; 103-615-496-808-551; 104-352-921-270-196; 122-033-465-479-352,7,true,cc-by,gold

Its clinical severity can range from mere cosmetic concerns to severe debilitation consequent to bleeding and deep vein thromboembolic episodes.[1] KTS can also be associated with abnormalities of the central nervous system (CNS) such as hydrocephalus, cerebral calcification, vascular malformations, cerebral and cerebellar hemihypertrophy.[2,3] Rarely, neurological and/or psychiatric disorders such as mental retardation, seizures, or bipolar affective disorders have been described.[1,4] We herein report a 35-year-old female, product of a nonconsanguineous marriage, referred to the dermatology OPD from the psychiatry ward where she was currently admitted due to complaints of feeling irritable, restless, ineffective, withdrawn, and continually distracted from work since about a year. A day before the current admission, she had physically and violently attacked her brother without any provocation. She also felt that all her family members and acquaintances at work were plotting to harm her. The parents opined her to be oversensitive over trivial matters and worsening over the years to become almost insular. On examination, she was found to be aware of her physical problems and was compliant to commands. Mental status examination revealed formal thought disorder and first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia. She was diagnosed as having grade 3 paranoid schizophrenia, i.e., being aware of the illness but attributing it to external factors. History and examination on dermatologist referral revealed the presence of well-defined varicosities on her left arm [Figure 1] around the axilla [Figure 2], cubital fossa [Figure 3], and forearm since birth along with gradually increasing hypertrophy of the 4th and 5th digits [Figure 4] of the left hand since 2-year consistent with a diagnosis of incomplete KTS. Doppler of the axilla revealed grade 3 dilated veins with normal blood flow. Karyotyping, as also biochemical and hematological parameters, were found to be normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain revealed prominent ventricles, sulci, Sylvian-fissure, and basal-cisterns implying mild diffuse cerebral atrophy [Figure 5]. There was no evidence of midline shift, intracranial bleed, or diffusion restriction. Corpus striatum, neuroparenchyma, sellar and parasellar structures along with major intracranial vessels and dural venous sinuses showed normal flow voids.Figure 1: Varicosities seen on the left axilla, cubital fossa, and forearm along with the hypertrophy of 4th and 5th digitsFigure 2: Varicosities - left axillaFigure 3: Varicosities – left cubital fossaFigure 4: Varicosities seen on left forearm along with the hypertrophy of 4th and 5th digitsFigure 5: Axial section of MRI brain in Flair mode at the level of ventricles showing a smaller total brain volume and prominent (a) ventricular system, (b) sylvian fissure and (c) sulci suggestive of mild cerebral atrophyThe patient is currently responding well to aripiprazole along with cognitive therapy. Structural brain abnormalities are well established in schizophrenia, with MRI consistently demonstrating a reduced global cerebral volume along with an increased lateral ventricular volume in its sufferers. Several studies have also reported these abnormalities to progress with time; with greater rates of progression being associated with a worse clinical prognosis. However, it remains unclear whether these changes are inherent to the disease processes underlying schizophrenia or are accelerated upon treatment with antipsychotic agents or other yet-unknown factors.[5] Cerebral hemimegaloencephaly and hemihypertrophy are the most frequent CNS findings reported in up to 18% of patients with KTS.[3] However, global cerebral atrophy-the intracranial abnormality demonstrated in our case has been documented earlier in only two cases of KTS (along with bilateral facial vascular abnormality), though without any evidence of schizophrenia.[5–7] The largest study exploring the psychosocial morbidities associated with KTS till date reported 23.2% of them to have a diagnosed psychiatric disorder (depression in 15% and anxiety in 5%), of which 15% had undergone treatment.[1] The study also reported that the highest prevalence of psychiatric disorder was seen in those above 50 years of age and concluded that KTS patients in pain had a significantly higher chance of developing a psychiatric condition.[1] This increased risk could be due to the diathesis-stress model which suggests that stress exposure on top of a preexisting vulnerability precipitates schizophrenia with increased risk of psychotic episodes.[8] To the best of our knowledge, this forms the first reported concurrence of KTS and paranoid schizophrenia and combined with earlier studies highlights the need to investigate the likelihood of psychiatric conditions in people with KTS. Patients should thus be routinely asked about symptoms of pain, particularly when factors that are more likely to be associated with pain are present.[1] Future larger prospective studies with a longer follow-up are required to define the association between psychiatric disorders and KTS more clearly.

It is for this reason that the hippocampus has been one of the most widely studied regions of the brain, and abnormality in hippocampal structure has been one of the most robust findings in schizophrenia. There is considerable evidence from postmortem and in vivo MRI studies that patients with schizophrenia have smaller hippocampi than normal comparison subjects. 1 – 4 Furthermore, volume deficits have been reported in first-episode schizophrenia patients and in some nonpsychotic relatives of schizophrenia probands. 5 – 9 These observations suggest that hippocampal volume reductions may be a trait marker or a biological indicator for genetic predisposition in schizophrenia. There are reasons to believe that differences exist between anterior and posterior regions of the hippocampus. Animal studies have shown that the primate hippocampus is topographically organized along the longitudinal axis, with the medial parts of the entorhinal cortex projecting to the anterior part of the hippocampus and the lateral parts projecting to the posterior hippocampus. 10 Empirical evidence for an anterior or posterior distinction of the hippocampus has also been observed in functional MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging. 11 – 12 Moreover, overactivity of the ventral hippocampus has been reported to increase dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, thus making us speculate that the anterior hippocampus may be more relevant to the pathophysiology in schizophrenia. 13 – 14 The anatomic specificity of hippocampal volume change in schizophrenia remains a matter of some debate. While some studies demonstrate selective volumetric deficits within the anterior aspect of the hippocampus, 15 – 16 others have indicated deficits within the posterior hippocampus, 17 – 18 and still others find no evidence for a differential deficit of volume across the anterior-posterior axis. 19 – 20 There are a number of factors that may explain the heterogeneity of these results, including differences in demographic variables, illness characteristics, and methodological inconsistencies in defining the boundaries to divide ""anterior"" from ""posterior."" In recent years there has been a great impetus world-wide in providing specialized psychiatric services for early detection and treatment of patients with first-episode psychosis. Although these patients present with symptoms of psychosis (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized behavior), they are a diagnostically heterogeneous group of individuals and very often the diagnoses become stable only over longitudinal follow-up. Nevertheless, they provide an exciting opportunity to study psychopathology and neurophysiology of psychotic diseases in the very early stages of the illness and without the confounding effects of psychotropic medications.The aims of our study were to examine hippocampal volume in minimally treated patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders (schizophrenia, schizophreniform, and schizoaffective disorders) relative to healthy comparison subjects and to assess if there were differences in the volume along the anterior-posterior axis.METHODSConsecutive referrals to the inpatient and outpatient services of the Early Psychosis Intervention Program (EPIP) in Singapore were invited to participate in the study. Patients with first episode of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, between the ages of 15 to 45 years, who had received no more than 4 weeks of neuroleptic medication, were recruited. They were excluded if they had a diagnosis of substance abuse, significant medical or neurological illness that could affect brain structure and function, or mental retardation. Comparison subjects matched for age and gender, with no personal or family history of a DSM axis I disorder, were recruited from the general population. All individuals (patients and comparison subjects) were right-handed as determined by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. 21 A complete description of the proposed study was given to each participant and written informed consent was obtained. The study was approved by the institutional review board. Patients were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) 22 for axis I diagnosis. They underwent a second diagnostic assessment 1 year later to confirm the stability of the diagnosis. Where the two diagnoses differed (baseline and 1 year), the diagnosis at 1 year was used. Comparison subjects were screened with the nonpatient version of the SCID. 23 For the patients, duration of untreated psychosis was determined by the time in months from the onset of psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized behavior) to the initiation of effective treatment, and the age of onset of illness was also calculated. The severity of psychopathology at first presentation was assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 24 as well the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale. 25A single session MRI scan was performed on a clinical 1.5 tesla MR system (Signa NVi, GE Medical Systems, Wis.) using a standard quadrature head coil. Patients and healthy comparison subjects were positioned in the magnet in a supine position, with arms relaxed by their side. The entire head volume was scanned in the coronal plane using a high resolution, fast gradient recalled echo (FGRE), 3-dimensional, volumetric, T1-weighted sequence (parameters TR/TE/TI/flip angle: 6.4/1.5/400/20°; field of view: 240×180 mm; matrix: 256×256; slice thickness: 1.5 mm, no interslice gap, number of excitations: 2; scan time: 5 minute 1 sec) for structural-anatomic detail. Magnetic resonance images were transferred to a SUN Sparc 10 workstation (SUN Microsystems, Mountain View, Calif.) for volumetric analysis using in-house MRreg v.1.6.2 software. 26 Hippocampal volume measurements were performed by an experienced reader blinded to the subject status and left-right anatomic orientation. Images were zoomed to a magnification of factor four with intensity windowing monitored continuously. The volume for each hippocampus was calculated by multiplying the number of voxels within each trace per slice by voxel volume. Currently, there is no standard way of defining the anterior and posterior hippocampus. We decided to use a quantitatively objective method that has been published before. 27 This method is based on the midway bisection of the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. The anterior end of the hippocampus is marked by the appearance of the amygdala, while the posterior end is marked by the appearance of the converging fornix in the superior direction. Based on the MRI coronal slices, the anterior and posterior portions of the hippocampus were designated by dividing the total number of slices in half; with the larger number of slices assigned to the anterior division when the total slice number was an odd number. The patients and comparison subjects did not differ significantly in the number of MRI slices comprising each hippocampal measurement volume. We matched comparison subjects and patients by gender and age (<20 years, 20–24 years, 25–29 years, 30–34 years, ≥35 years). Independent sample t tests were performed to compare the height and years of schooling between the patients and comparison subjects, as well as to look at hippocampal volume differences based on gender and between patients and comparison subjects. Group×gender interaction (i.e., male patients versus male comparison subjects and female patients versus female comparison subjects) were also done. A general linear model with grouped-matching as a random factor (to take into clustering effect) was carried out to examine the differences in mean hippocampal volumes of patients versus comparison subjects adjusting for age, height, and years of schooling. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05 (two-tailed).RESULTS Thirty-nine patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 29 comparison subjects participated in the study. Among the patient group, 82.1% were Chinese (n=32), 10.3% were Malays (n=4), 5.1% were Indians (n=2), and 2.6% were Eurasians (n=1). Among the comparison group, 69.0% were Chinese (n=20), 13.8% were Malay (n=4), and 17.2% were Indians (n=5). The other demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table 1 . The comparison subjects had significantly more years of schooling (p<0.05). Also, the female patients were significantly shorter in height (p<0.05) than the male patients. Female patients did not significantly differ from the male patients in terms of age of onset of illness, or total PANSS and GAF scores. TABLE 1. Clinical and Demographic Characteristics of First-Episode Patients and Comparison SubjectsTABLE 1. Clinical and Demographic Characteristics of First-Episode Patients and Comparison SubjectsEnlarge tableFemales had very significantly smaller right, anterior, and total (p<0.005) hippocampal volumes as compared with the males. The right anterior, right posterior, left anterior, right, left, and total hippocampal volumes were also observed to be significantly smaller in the females (p<0.05). The patients had significantly smaller right anterior (p=0.008), right (p=0.015), and anterior (p=0.021) hippocampal volumes relative to comparison subjects. On analyzing differences between patients and comparison subjects by gender (i.e., splitting the file by gender and comparing volumes between patients and comparison subjects), there were no significant differences in the hippocampal volumes between male patients and comparison subjects. However, the female patients had significantly smaller right anterior (p=0.006), right (p=0.012) and anterior (p=0.006) hippocampal volumes than the female comparison subjects. General linear model controlling for age, gender, height, years of schooling, and diagnosis showed that there was a significant effect of diagnosis and gender on the right anterior (p=0.006 and 0.04, respectively), right (p=0.01, and 0.03), and anterior volumes (p=0.02 and 0.02). TABLE 2. Anterior and Posterior Hippocampal Volumes in Patients and Comparison SubjectsTABLE 2. Anterior and Posterior Hippocampal Volumes in Patients and Comparison SubjectsEnlarge tableDISCUSSION Our finding of a smaller anterior hippocampus in patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders relative to healthy comparison subjects is similar to that reported in previous studies. 15 – 16 Our patients were scanned as soon as they were stable enough to tolerate the MRI scan, and hence their exposure to antipsychotic medication was minimal. They also did not have a history of substance use. Hence it is very unlikely that the smaller anterior hippocampus was due to the effects of antipsychotics or any other psychoactive substances. Although the patients had significantly fewer years of education than the comparison subjects, there was no significant correlation between the hippocampal volumes and years of education, and statistical adjustment for educational levels did not alter the results. In fact, matching for educational level can be problematic because it would exclude patients with poorer premorbid adjustment caused possibly by prodromal symptoms of psychosis. The anterior hippocampus is predominantly connected with the limbic and striatal systems and, given the hypotheses that failures in the modulation of the limbic and striatal mechanisms are relevant to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia 28 and to the mechanisms of action of antipsychotic drugs, 29 the finding of a structurally smaller anterior hippocampus adds further credence to this theory. The presence of this abnormality at the beginning of the illness may also indicate that a smaller anterior hippocampus may be a trait marker of the illness either due to a genetic susceptibility or early environmental damage, as suggested by studies that have found smaller hippocampal volumes in nonaffected first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia as well as linked this finding with fetal hypoxia. 30 In fact, the neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion in the rat has been used as a model of schizophrenia. The same authors have also shown that this early insult to the ventral hippocampus causes reduction in dopamine transporter (DAT) mRNA, although it is unclear whether this reduction coincides with the emergence of behavioral changes in young adulthood or whether it is present from early in life. 31 – 32 We also found that there was a gender by diagnosis effect with the female patients showing significantly smaller anterior and right hippocampal volumes than female comparison subjects; an effect that was not seen in the male patients. Male and female patients with schizophrenia do differ in their clinical manifestations with females presenting with later age of onset, better premorbid social adjustment, and better long-term outcomes. 33 – 35 The male and female patients in our study did not differ significantly with regards to their age of onset and severity of psychopathology at the time of presentation, as measured by duration of untreated psychosis, PANSS, and GAF. The mean age of onset in our female patients was later than the male patients but it was not statistically significant. In fact, this is in line with the older age of onset in females. Interestingly the male patients in our sample seemed to have a later age of onset than what is normally seen in schizophrenia, and it is possible that this later onset of illness helped the male patients escape the early insult to the hippocampus. Some previous studies looking at gender differences in schizophrenia have reported that male patients appear to manifest greater severity of structural impairment and had smaller hippocampal volumes than the female patients. 9 , 36 There have been other studies that have not found any significant effect of gender. 3 , 37 Our finding of a smaller right hippocampus in females is similar to that reported by Collinson and colleagues. 38 They assessed the volumes of right and left cerebral hemispheres in early onset schizophrenia and found that the female patients had a significantly reduced rightward asymmetry relative to the female control subjects, indicating that in females there is a volume loss that is relatively greater in the right hemisphere. We note some possible limitations with our study. As a surrogate measure for intracranial volume, height was used. We also did not look at neurocognitive correlates of anterior versus posterior hippocampus that could provide further evidence for anterior and posterior differentiation of hippocampus in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Lastly, although we found a gender by diagnosis interaction, our study was not primarily designed to look at gender differences; hence this finding needs to be replicated in another study that is powered to look at the effects of gender in patients as well as healthy comparison subjects. Further research exploring anterior-posterior differentiation of the hippocampus using not only neurocognitive measures but also the connectivity with techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging could shed more light into some of these issues.Received May 14, 2007; revised October 9, 2007; accepted December 10, 2007.

The features have to accurately capture main AD-related variations of anatomical brain structures, such as, e.g., ventricles size, hippocampus shape, cortical thickness, and brain volume. This paper proposes to predict the AD with a deep 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), which can learn generic features capturing AD biomarkers and adapt to different domain datasets. The 3D-CNN is built upon a 3D convolutional autoencoder, which is pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in structural brain MRI scans. Fully connected upper layers of the 3D-CNN are then fine-tuned for each task-specific AD classification.

Several T1-weighted MRI-based radiomic features were considered as explanatory variables in the prediction model.; RESULTS;  The best radiomic predictor was the relative brain volume defined as the ratio between the volume of the brain without cerebrospinal fluid and the volume of the whole brain multiplied by 100%. The model was trained on the ADNI dataset and tested on the independent EDSD dataset. The proposed method confirmed its quality by achieving a balanced accuracy of 95.18%, AUC of 93.25%, NPV of 97.93%, and PPV of 90.48% for classifying AD vs NC for the EDSD. The comparison of two models: with the MMSE score only as an independent variable, and corrected for the relative brain value and age, shows that the addition of an MRI-based biomarker improves the quality of MCI detection (AUC: 67.04% vs 71.08%) while maintaining quality for AD (AUC: 93.35% vs 93.25%). Additionally, among MCI patients predicted as AD inconsistently with original diagnosis, 56.25% from ADNI and 54.17% from EDSD were re-diagnosed as AD within a 48-month follow-up. It shows that our model can detect AD patients a few years earlier than a standard medical diagnosis.; CONCLUSIONS;  The created method is non-invasive, inexpensive, clinically accessible, and efficiently supports the AD/MCI diagnosis.</jats:p>",,,,,Cognitive impairment; Logistic regression; Multinomial logistic regression; Medicine; Internal medicine; Disease; Psychology; Computer science; Machine learning,,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1747001/latest.pdf https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1747001/v1,http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1747001/v1,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-1747001/v1,,,0,,0,true,cc-by,green

Numerous factors exist that may or may not be related to the lifestyle of a patient that result in a higher risk for AD. Diagnosing the disorder in its beginning period is important, and several techniques are used to diagnose AD. A number of studies have been conducted on the detection and diagnosis of AD. This paper reports the empirical study performed on the longitudinal-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Open Access Series of Brain Imaging dataset. Furthermore, the study highlights several factors that influence the prediction of AD.; Objective: This study aimed to correlate the effect of various factors such as age, gender, education, and socioeconomic background of patients with the development of AD. The effect of patient-related factors on the severity of AD was assessed on the basis of MRI features, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV), normalized whole brain volume (nWBV), and Atlas Scaling Factor (ASF).; Methods: In this study, we attempted to establish the role of longitudinal MRI in an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of AD patients. EDA was performed on the dataset of 150 patients for 343 MRI sessions (mean age 77.01 [SD 7.64] years). The T1-weighted MRI of each subject on a 1.5-Tesla Vision (Siemens) scanner was used for image acquisition. Scores of three features, MMSE, CDR, and ASF, were used to characterize the AD patients included in this study. We assessed the role of various features (ie, age, gender, education, socioeconomic status, MMSE, CDR, eTIV, nWBV, and ASF) on the prognosis of AD.; Results: The analysis further establishes the role of gender in the prevalence and development of AD in older people. Moreover, a considerable relationship has been observed between education and socioeconomic position on the progression of AD. Also, outliers and linearity of each feature were determined to rule out the extreme values in measuring the skewness. The differences in nWBV between CDR=0 (nondemented), CDR=0.5 (very mild dementia), and CDR=1 (mild dementia) are significant (ie, P<.01).; Conclusions: A substantial correlation has been observed between the pattern and other related features of longitudinal MRI data that can significantly assist in the diagnosis and determination of AD in older patients.",5,1,e14389,,Correlation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pediatrics; Mini–Mental State Examination; Dementia; Clinical Dementia Rating; Alzheimer's disease; Neuroimaging; Brain size; Medicine,,,,,http://biomedeng.jmir.org/2020/1/e14389/ https://biomedeng.jmir.org/2020/1/e14389/,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/14389,,10.2196/14389,3006448441,,0,000-199-206-963-760; 001-302-113-568-875; 002-291-937-960-541; 004-836-707-391-304; 005-047-011-215-526; 010-100-745-413-733; 015-419-443-690-731; 017-668-673-488-280; 018-736-426-656-986; 019-166-239-301-818; 019-705-482-619-914; 020-916-670-117-116; 030-655-710-518-986; 036-166-448-676-639; 036-350-017-814-921; 036-735-721-314-223; 040-319-654-480-775; 041-082-631-267-756; 050-409-012-822-333; 053-665-953-741-107; 056-155-229-779-605; 074-227-623-719-371; 077-273-307-091-97X; 081-849-790-529-890; 099-545-506-699-763; 116-213-991-702-519; 154-400-050-577-666,10,true,cc-by,gold

Clinical,22131582,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Owen Crystal; Pejman J Maralani; Sandra Black; Corinne Fischer; Alan R Moody; April Khademi,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and while it presents as an imperative intervention window, it is difficult to detect which subjects convert to AD (cMCI) and which ones remain stable (sMCI). The objective of this work was to investigate fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI biomarkers and their ability to differentiate between sMCI and cMCI subjects in cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Three types of biomarkers were investigated: volume, intensity and texture. Volume biomarkers included total brain volume, cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSF), lateral ventricular volume, white matter lesion volume, subarachnoid CSF, and grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM), all normalized to intracranial volume. The mean intensity, kurtosis, and skewness of the GM and WM made up the intensity features. Texture features quantified homogeneity and microstructural tissue changes of GM and WM regions. Composite indices were also considered, which are biomarkers that represent an aggregate sum (z-score normalization and summation) of all biomarkers. The FLAIR MRI biomarkers successfully identified high-risk subjects as significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between the means of the sMCI and cMCI groups and the rate of change over time for several individual biomarkers as well as the composite indices for both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Classification accuracy and feature importance analysis showed volume biomarkers to be most predictive, however, best performance was obtained when complimenting the volume biomarkers with the intensity and texture features. Using all the biomarkers, accuracy of 86.2 % and 69.2 % was achieved for normal control-AD and sMCI-cMCI classification respectively. Survival analysis demonstrated that the majority of the biomarkers showed a noticeable impact on the AD conversion probability 4 years prior to conversion. Composite indices were the top performers for all analyses including feature importance, classification, and survival analysis. This demonstrated their ability to summarize various dimensions of disease into single-valued metrics. Significant correlation (p < 0.05) with phosphorylated-tau and amyloid-beta CSF biomarkers was found with all the FLAIR biomarkers. The proposed biomarker system is easily attained as FLAIR is routinely acquired, models are not computationally intensive and the results are explainable, thus making this pipeline easily integrated into clinical workflow.",40,,103533,103533,Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery; White matter; Medicine; Brain size; Cerebrospinal fluid; Neuroimaging; Magnetic resonance imaging; Grey matter; Nuclear medicine; Internal medicine; Radiology; Psychiatry,Alzheimer’s disease; Biomarkers; FLAIR MRI; Mild cognitive impairment,Humans; Alzheimer Disease/pathology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Amyloid beta-Peptides/cerebrospinal fluid; Cognitive Dysfunction/cerebrospinal fluid; Biomarkers/cerebrospinal fluid; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; tau Proteins/cerebrospinal fluid; Disease Progression; Peptide Fragments/cerebrospinal fluid,Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; tau Proteins; Peptide Fragments,Alzheimer Society; Government of Ontario; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2023.103533,37952286,10.1016/j.nicl.2023.103533,,PMC10666029,0,001-363-163-587-838; 006-584-477-403-393; 008-989-867-184-42X; 010-239-067-603-322; 014-251-485-963-985; 015-622-243-773-632; 016-198-841-742-293; 019-925-262-977-757; 019-952-461-283-911; 021-254-065-724-459; 022-764-013-109-311; 024-915-754-540-385; 025-809-005-387-691; 026-061-313-443-789; 028-594-298-152-389; 028-938-354-899-02X; 029-233-453-515-200; 032-874-317-627-847; 033-824-953-742-193; 034-270-410-745-835; 035-533-664-974-679; 040-735-390-921-292; 041-318-253-368-194; 043-348-573-940-487; 043-411-883-196-090; 043-830-981-209-98X; 046-861-213-660-939; 048-249-148-788-910; 050-520-629-272-074; 058-258-312-566-939; 062-061-819-555-708; 066-541-292-495-064; 067-624-188-366-473; 069-192-124-528-556; 073-380-800-914-077; 075-772-222-149-451; 075-993-636-063-18X; 079-003-712-121-928; 079-464-276-519-332; 085-789-139-115-481; 096-571-469-439-187; 096-907-830-402-34X; 100-177-999-935-476; 110-127-064-789-765; 115-296-615-704-481; 116-008-284-714-614; 126-507-781-102-60X; 142-382-288-943-046,3,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

These may partly stem from confounding bias, which could distort associations and limit generalizability. We examined how associations between brain morphology and ADHD symptoms change with adjustments for potential confounders typically overlooked in the literature (aim 1), and for the intelligence quotient (IQ) and head motion, which are generally corrected for but play ambiguous roles (aim 2). Methods: Participants were 10-year-old children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (N = 7722) and Generation R (N = 2531) Studies. Cortical area, volume, and thickness were measured with MRI and ADHD symptoms with the Child Behavior Checklist. Surface-based cross-sectional analyses were run. Results: ADHD symptoms related to widespread cortical regions when solely adjusting for demographic factors. Additional adjustments for socioeconomic and maternal behavioral confounders (aim 1) generally attenuated associations, as cluster sizes halved and effect sizes substantially reduced. Cluster sizes further changed when including IQ and head motion (aim 2), however, we argue that adjustments might have introduced bias. Conclusions: Careful confounder selection and control can help identify more robust and specific regions of associations for ADHD symptoms, across two cohorts. We provided guidance to minimizing confounding bias in psychiatric neuroimaging.

The strength of the evidence presented is convincing and solid. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.78002.sa0 Decision letter Reviews on Sciety eLife's review process Introduction Large strides have been made in the identification of neuroanatomical correlates of psychiatric problems, with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) being a prominent example. ADHD is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in children worldwide and is characterized by atypical levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Structural magnetic resonance imaging studies have highlighted that children with ADHD show widespread morphological differences, such as in the basal ganglia (Nakao et al., 2011), subcortical areas (Hoogman et al., 2017), and frontal, cingulate, and temporal cortices, compared to children without the disorder (Hoogman et al., 2019; Shaw et al., 2013). Consistently identifying the neuroanatomical substrate of ADHD, however, remains challenging. A recent meta-analysis did not find convergence across the literature on brain differences in children and adolescents with ADHD (Samea et al., 2019). One possible explanation for this inconsistency is the multifaceted nature of ADHD, in which children with the disorder have heterogeneous presentations on several cognitive and emotional domains, which could stem from distinct brain structural substrates. Other explanations regard study design. If suboptimal, it may lead to biased estimates and lack of generalizability, thus potentially concealing robust and replicable relations of brain morphology with ADHD. The present study focuses on confounding, a common source of bias in etiological studies. Confounding bias arises when a third variable affects both the determinant (independent variable) and outcome (dependent variable) of interest (i.e., is a common cause) (VanderWeele, 2019). Confounding leads to over- or underestimation of the true effect between determinant and outcome and can even change the direction of an association. To minimize confounding bias, appropriate confounder control is paramount, although it is challenging, especially in observational studies like most neuroimaging studies of ADHD. Previous literature and expert knowledge can guide the identification of potential confounders (Hernan and Robins, 2020), which can then be appropriately adjusted for in regression models or using methods such as restriction, standardization, or propensity scores. Within neuroimaging studies of ADHD, except for a few large investigations (Hoogman et al., 2017; Mous et al., 2014; Bernanke et al., 2022), studies have generally matched or adjusted for a few demographic variables (e.g., age and sex) and neuroimaging metrics or parameters. Of the 19 studies included in a systematic review of neuroimaging studies on ADHD (Saad et al., 2020), 17 adjusted or matched for age in their analyses, 14 for sex, 9 for neuroimaging-related variables like head motion during scanning, and 8 for the intelligence quotient (IQ) (Supplementary file 1a). Further potential confounders should, however, be considered. For instance, socioeconomic status (SES) is related to both higher risk for ADHD and variation in cortical brain structure (Russell et al., 2016; Noble et al., 2015). Thus, it is likely a confounder. Lack of adjustment for SES may have therefore concealed key relations between ADHD and brain structure. Adjustment choices are dependent on the availability of large samples with data on a wide variety of covariates, which has to date been limited for psychiatric neuroimaging studies. Yet, this is rapidly changing with the advent of population neuroscience, which entails large-scale studies with neurobiological data. This lends new opportunities for further confounder adjustments to be considered in neuroimaging studies of ADHD. Conversely, previous studies have adjusted for IQ and head motion, which may not be confounders in the association between ADHD symptoms and the brain, and may thus have led to further bias in the results (Dennis et al., 2009). In this study, we examined the association between brain structure and ADHD symptoms and how the selection and control for potential confounders may affect results (aim 1). Moreover, we discussed the complex role of IQ and head motion in brain structure–ADHD associations and the potential consequences of adjusting for them (aim 2). We leveraged two large, population-based cohorts: the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and the Generation R Studies. In line with most neuroimaging studies, we adopted a cross-sectional design. Results Associations between ADHD symptoms and brain morphology are widespread We analyzed data from 10-year-old children from the ABCD (N = 7722, multisite) and Generation R (N = 2531, single-site) Studies (Supplementary file 1b). ADHD symptoms were measured with the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL). T1-weighted images were obtained with 3T scanners (Casey et al., 2018; Kooijman et al., 2016). We ran vertex-wise linear regression models for ADHD with cortical surface area, volume, and thickness. Results for surface area, which constituted the main findings here, are presented in-text, while findings for volume and thickness in the figure supplements. We adjusted for demographic and study characteristics which have been generally considered by previous literature (Supplementary file 1a): age, sex, ethnicity, and study site (ABCD only). We refer to this model as model 1, as further adjustments for confounders are outlined in subsequent steps. We found that higher ADHD symptoms were associated with less bilateral surface area in both cohorts. As shown in Figure 1, associations were widespread, as the clusters of association covered 1165.7 cm2 of the cerebral cortex in the ABCD Study, and 446.1 cm2 in the Generation R Study. Across both cohorts, we consistently identified clusters for surface area in the lateral occipital, postcentral, rostral middle and superior frontal, and superior parietal cortices. For cortical thickness, we found two small frontal clusters in the ABCD Study (16.1 cm2) and no clusters in the Generation R Study, which suggests that cortical thickness does not relate or does not relate strongly to ADHD, in line with prior literature (Hoogman et al., 2019; Figure 1—figure supplement 1).

Note. Rows represent the results for the ABCD or Generation R Studies, and the columns represent the left and right hemispheres. Regions in red represent significant clusters from model 1 (adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and site [ABCD only]). Confounder selection: socioeconomic and maternal behavioral factors Next, we considered factors that have been previously linked to ADHD and brain structure in the literature, and are thus potential confounders. To illustrate this background knowledge and the assumptions about relations between variables, we used Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), a type of causal diagram (Hernan and Robins, 2020). These guide the identification (and dismissal) of covariates that may act as confounders. Of note, while assumptions may not hold, this theoretical approach is preferred to methods selecting confounders based on model statistics (Lee, 2014). The DAGs are depicted in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2, and the rationales for variable inclusion are explained below and in the Methods. Figure 2 with 2 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for brain structure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms (simplified). Note. DAGs illustrating potential confounders in the association between brain structure and ADHD symptoms for three sequential models. Model 1 included demographic and study characteristics: sex, age, ethnicity, and study site (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development [ABCD] only) (in blue). Model 2 additionally included socioeconomic status factors: family income, maternal education, and maternal age at childbirth (in red). Model 3 additionally incorporated postnatal maternal psychopathology and maternal substance use during pregnancy (in green). Based on the literature, lower SES is associated with a higher risk for ADHD (Russell et al., 2016) and with variation in cortical brain structure (Noble et al., 2015). Thus, confounding by socioeconomic factors in the relation between ADHD and brain morphology is likely. We therefore additionally adjusted for a second set of confounders (model 2) related to SES: household income, maternal education, and maternal age at childbirth. Moreover, several factors concerning maternal behavior, pre- and postnatally, have been associated with both ADHD and brain morphology. For instance, prenatal exposure to substances is known to increase the risk of developing ADHD symptoms and has been associated with variation in cerebral volume and surface area (Eilertsen et al., 2017; Lees et al., 2020). Postnatal maternal psychopathology has been linked to higher child ADHD symptoms (Clavarino et al., 2010) and smaller brain volume in children (Zou et al., 2019). Thus, in model 3 we additionally adjusted for prenatal exposure to substance use (tobacco and cannabis), and postnatal maternal psychopathology. Adjusting for additional confounders led to reductions in the clusters of association Adjustments for SES (model 2) led to reductions in the spatial extent of the clusters for surface area and volume in both cohorts (Figure 3). For surface area, cluster sizes for ADHD symptoms reduced from 1165.7 cm2 in model 1 to 952.8 cm2 in model 2 (=−18%) in the ABCD Study, and from 446.1 to 229.6 cm2 (=−49%) in the Generation R Study. Similar reductions were observed for volume and thickness (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). After adjusting for the confounders added in model 3, across both cohorts, we consistently identified clusters for surface area in the cuneus, precuneus, fusiform, inferior parietal, isthmus of the cingulate, pericalcarine, pre- and postcentral, rostral middle and superior frontal, superior temporal and supramarginal cortices.

Regions in red represent significant clusters from model 1 (sex, age, race/ethnicity, and site [ABCD only]), orange from model 2 (model 1 + family income, maternal education, and maternal age at childbirth), and yellow from model 3 (model 2 + maternal smoking, substance use during pregnancy, psychopathology). Similar results were observed for ADHD diagnosis To explore whether the results observed for associations between brain morphology and ADHD symptoms applied to children with an ADHD diagnosis, we repeated the primary analysis using the ADHD diagnostic data from the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (KSADS) in the ABCD Study. In line with our primary results, ADHD diagnosis was associated with less bilateral surface area and volume. Compared to clusters for ADHD symptoms, those associated with ADHD diagnosis were smaller, but overlapping (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We observed similar patterns of reduction in the spatial extent of the clusters after adjusting for each set of confounders (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). For surface area, cluster sizes for ADHD symptoms covered 234.4 cm2 in model 1 and reduced to 199.5 cm2 in model 2 (=−15%), and 55.5 cm2 in model 3 (=−72%, compared to model 2). Beta coefficients generally decreased after confounder adjustments, but may also increase Surface-based studies generally focus on the spatial extent of cortical clusters associated with the phenotype, but, in this study, we also explored how confounding adjustments affected the regression coefficients for ADHD symptoms (Figure 4).

Note. The colors denote the different models, and the circles denote the average of all the betas within that region. The regions are based on the Desikan–Killiany atlas. Results for the ABCD and Generation R Studies are, respectively, shown on the top and bottom. At a vertex-wise level, adjusting for socioeconomic and maternal factors (model 3) led to reductions in the beta coefficients, across the brain, for both cohorts (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Of note, some beta coefficients also showed increases. As confounding bias may lead to under- or overestimation, it is not surprising to observe both decreases and increases in the average beta coefficients after adjustments. At an anatomical region level, where estimates of vertices within a given Desikan–Killiany region were averaged, beta coefficients for surface area tended to decrease from model 1 to 2 by approximately 15% (Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Further adjustments from model 2 to 3 led to decreases in the average beta coefficients of certain regions and increases in others. Similar patterns were found for volume (Figure 4—figure supplements 3 and 4). The average beta coefficients per region correlated moderately to strongly between the ABCD and Generation R Studies for surface area (Spearman rM1 = 0.84, rM2 = 0.83, rM3 = 0.83) and volume (Spearman rM1 = 0.57, rM2 = 0.57, rM3 = 0.70) (Figure 4—figure supplement 5). IQ may be a confounder, mediator, or collider in neuroanatomical studies of ADHD We considered one additional scenario which included IQ, a factor that is often adjusted for in previous studies (Supplementary file 1a). However, based on prior literature, it holds an ambiguous role in structural anatomy–ADHD relations. Previous studies found that children with ADHD scored lower on IQ than children without ADHD (Bridgett and Walker, 2006). Differential brain structure with levels of IQ has also been shown (Mcdaniel, 2005). However, the directions of causation between these variables remain unclear (Gallo and Posner, 2016). IQ may therefore be a confounder, collider, and/or mediator in the relation between brain structure and ADHD, as depicted in the DAGs in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1. Figure 5 with 1 supplement see all Download asset Open asset Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for intelligence quotient (IQ), brain structure, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Note. (A) DAG for IQ as a confounder. In this case, adjustments are needed as the backdoor path from brain structure to ADHD symptoms through IQ is open. By adjusting (box around IQ), the path gets closed. (B) DAG for IQ as a mediator. Adjustments are not needed to estimate the total effect of brain structure on ADHD symptoms. (C) DAG for IQ as a collider. The backdoor path through IQ is already closed. Adjustments would open the path and lead to collider bias. First, it could be argued that IQ is partly innate and precedes brain development and ADHD, making it a confounder (Figure 5A). Second, IQ may lie in the pathway between brain structure and ADHD and therefore act as a mediator (Figure 5B). It is conceivable that cognitive differences, as a consequence of subtle neurodevelopmental differences (Lee et al., 2019), could underlie ADHD. Adjusting for a mediator would lead to bias when estimating the total association between brain structure and ADHD (VanderWeele, 2016). Third, brain structure may impact intelligence scores (Lee et al., 2019), and ADHD symptoms may affect IQ test performance (Jepsen et al., 2009; Figure 5C). A variable that is independently caused by the outcome and the determinant is also known as a collider, and adjusting for it leads to (collider) bias. Here, we explored the impact of adjusting for IQ when examining the relation between brain morphology and ADHD (model 4). Adjustments for IQ led to further cluster reductions After additionally adjusting for IQ, the spatial extent of the clusters associated with ADHD symptoms reduced further in both cohorts (Figure 6). For surface area, compared to model 3, clusters reduced from 760.2 to 605.1 cm2 (=−20%) for the ABCD Study, and from 208.6 to 93.1 cm2 for the Generation R Study (=−55%). Clusters of association for surface area in model 4 were located in the fusiform, inferior parietal, insula, lateral occipital, middle temporal, pericalcarine, pre- and postcentral, precuneus, rostral middle, and superior frontal, superior parietal and temporal, and supramarginal cortices. Findings for volume and thickness are shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.

The colors denote the different models, with red vertices being significant only in model 3, orange ones in both model 3 and after adjustment for IQ, and yellow ones only after adjusting for IQ. Head motion does not induce confounding bias, but information bias A final scenario was also included, to reflect the commonly used adjustments for head motion during scanning (Supplementary file 1a). Motion can be a large source of bias in neuroimaging studies which is important to address. While it does not meet the criteria for confounding as it is not a common cause of ADHD problems and brain morphology (Hernan and Robins, 2020), head motion can induce measurement error of brain morphology (Van de Walle et al., 1997; Figure 7). This is also referred to as information bias and can distort estimates from their true value. Figure 7 Download asset Open asset Information bias for brain structure, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, and head motion. Note. From the bottom up: We aim to measure the 'true' values of brain structure and ADHD symptoms. However, we actually measure both brain structure and ADHD symptoms imperfectly, at the MRI and through self-reports, respectively. What we assess is therefore affected by measurement errors. Error in the MRI measurement is determined, in part, by excessive motion during scanning. Higher ADHD symptoms likely cause higher motion (dotted red path). This leads to differential information bias and creates a non-causal path from ADHD symptoms to brain structure through motion. The amount of measurement error in brain morphology may differ across children with versus without ADHD. In fact, children with impulsivity and inattention have been shown to move more during MRI scanning (Thomson et al., 2021; Kong et al., 2014), determining different levels of error in the brain morphology assessments (Figure 7, path from ADHD symptoms to motion to error in MRI measurement). In this scenario, adjusting for motion might lead to two situations. On one hand, since motion is a consequence of the outcome (ADHD), adjustments would lead to bias (Westreich, 2012). On the other hand, not adjusting for motion would also lead to bias because part of the observed relation between ADHD symptoms and brain structure would be due to the higher head motion (and thus the underestimation of the cortical values) of children with ADHD. In this study, we explored the effect of adjusting for motion during scanning in the relation between brain morphology and ADHD (model 5). Adjustments for head motion led to increases in clusters After additional adjustments for head motion, the spatial extent of the clusters generally increased. For surface area, compared to model 3, clusters increased from 760.2 to 936.4 cm2 (=+23.2%) for the ABCD Study and from 208.6 to 239.7 cm2 (=+14.9%) for the Generation R Study (Figure 8). Clusters of associations consistently found across cohorts were highly similar to the ones identified in model 3. Results for cortical volume and thickness are shown in Figure 8—figure supplement 1. Figure 8 with 1 supplement see all Download asset Open asset Significant clusters in the association of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms with cortical surface area based on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and Generation R Studies, after additional adjustment for motion. Note. Rows represent the results for the ABCD or Generation R Studies, and the columns represent the left and right hemispheres. The colors denote the different models, with red vertices being significant only in model 3, orange ones in both model 3 and after adjustment for motion, and yellow ones only after adjusting for motion. Discussion By leveraging two large population-based studies and adopting a literature- and DAG-informed approach to address confounding, we showed that (1) associations between brain structure and ADHD symptoms, which were initially widespread, reduced when adjusting for socioeconomic and maternal behavioral confounders, and that (2) careful considerations are needed when including IQ and/or head motion due to their complex relation with ADHD and brain morphology. Adjustments for confounders highlighted key regions of association, observed across two large cohorts Widespread associations between surface area and ADHD symptoms were initially identified, with higher symptoms relating to smaller brain structures, in line with previous research (Hoogman et al., 2019; Gehricke et al., 2017). After adjustments for potential confounders typically overlooked by prior literature (socioeconomic and maternal behavioral factors), approximately half of the associations remained, and considerable effect size changes were observed in both the ABCD and Generation R Studies and for all cortical measures. We observed similar patterns of cluster reductions for ADHD diagnosis in the ABCD Study. Regions that remained associated after adjustments and which were consistently identified across cohorts were the precuneus, isthmus of the cingulate, supramarginal, pre- and postcentral, and inferior parietal cortices for both area and volume. Most of these regions (e.g., supramarginal) have been previously implicated in ADHD in clinical samples (Saad et al., 2017; Lei et al., 2014; Solanto et al., 2009). However, many different brain areas have been detected in association with the disorder (Saad et al., 2020), which may have hampered prior meta-analytic efforts to identify consistent neuroanatomical correlates for ADHD. Of note, some inconsistencies between the ABCD and Generation R Studies, both in size of the clusters and the exact location, were observed. While we used the same processing pipelines and similar quality control procedures and measures across cohorts, potential reasons for discrepancies in results must be discussed. First, the larger sample size of the ABCD Study allows for greater power to detect smaller effects, which led to larger associated areas. Second, the multisite structure of the ABCD Study may have introduced noise in the results (e.g., by different scanners, demographic differences), and determined the identification of associations which are not replicable in the Generation R Study. Third, the two studies include children from different populations. While both are very diverse samples, the ABCD Study is comprised of a more heterogeneous sample from the US population, which, for instance, is characterized by a wider variety of ethnicities and cultures, potentially permitting the discovery of more associations. Nevertheless, there was considerable overlap in the findings from the ABCD and Generation R Studies, with consistencies across cohorts indicating the most robust and generalizable associations. Here, we discerned associated areas likely subject to confounding bias from areas robust to socioeconomic and maternal behavioral factors, and replicable across two large cohorts. Comparisons with prior findings should be made with caution due to differences in study design, samples (clinical vs. population-based), and analytical methods. Importantly, we highlighted the opportunity for future studies to include covariates that go beyond age and sex, can help refine associations, and can be readily collected. Future studies may want to consider other confounding factors, depending on their research question, design, and assumed causal relations. Adjustments for IQ are often unnecessary when examining the relation between brain structure and ADHD Avoiding bias from adjusting for variables that are not confounders is as important as identifying sources of confounding. Adjusting for mediators or colliders of the ADHD–brain structure relation would induce bias. Here, when adjusting for IQ, which plays an unclear role in brain structure–ADHD associations, cluster sizes reduced considerably in both the ABCD and Generation R Studies. This could indicate that IQ is a confounder, in which case adjustments would be necessary, or that IQ is a mediator or collider, in which case adjustments must be avoided. First, based on previous literature and this study, the association between ADHD and IQ is relatively weak (Dennis et al., 2009) (rABCD = −0.11, rGENR = −0.14), but this does not necessarily make it a weak confounder as the strength of confounding is due to a variable's relation with the exposure and outcome. Second, if brain structure and ADHD symptoms both cause cognitive changes, adjusting for IQ could induce collider bias, although this is also dependent on when IQ is measured relative to the exposure and outcome (Hernan and Robins, 2020). Third, if brain structure determines cognitive functioning, which in turn affects ADHD symptoms (mediation by IQ), adjustments would also induce bias (VanderWeele, 2016). Given these scenarios, we recommend moving away from routinely adjusting for IQ in ADHD neuroimaging studies, and we highlight the need to carefully consider the causal model for a specific research question to determine whether IQ may confound associations. There is no easy fix for dealing with head motion in brain morphology–ADHD associations Adjustments for neuroimaging covariates, such as head motion, are often run to reduce confounding bias. However, head motion, rather than inducing confounding bias, creates measurement error (information bias). When adjusting for head motion during scanning, we observed increases in the spatial extent of the clusters. This might indicate a reduction or an increase in bias. First, bias might have been reduced by adjusting for the fact that children with ADHD will have more error in their cortical measures. Second, bias might have also been increased because we conditioned for head motion, which is a consequence of ADHD. Overall, the role of head motion in the relation between brain structure and ADHD is complex",,,,,Confounding; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Brain morphometry; Psychology; Generalizability theory; Brain size; Neuropsychology; Neuroimaging; Clinical psychology; Cognition; Developmental psychology; Medicine; Psychiatry; Magnetic resonance imaging; Internal medicine; Radiology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.78002.sa2,,10.7554/elife.78002.sa2,,,0,,1,true,,gold
132-279-395-936-206,A seed and soil model of loneliness in Alzheimer's disease.,2024-03-01,2024,journal article,Neural regeneration research,16735374; 18767958,Medknow,China,Hannah L Apostolou; Ian M McDonough,"Loneliness is classically defined as a result of perceiving a discrepancy between the desired quantity and quality of one's social life and actual social relationships (Perlman and Peplau, 1984). Lifespan research has indicated older adults are among the highest risk for experiencing loneliness because their social network size decreases more frequently than that of younger adults. In part, this is due to the growing risk of losing one's partner and peers through death, the loss of social roles, and limitations of mobility. Despite this risk, levels of loneliness are highly stable in old age and relatively low compared to other points in the lifespan, likely owing to the improved emotion regulation skills often found among healthy older adults (Mund et al., 2020). However, to the extent that increases in loneliness do occur among older adults, this subset of individuals might be at advanced risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related neurocognitive disorders (Lara et al., 2019). In the present perspective paper, we use the seed and soil model of neurocognitive disorders to better understand how loneliness impacts the brain to potentially increase one's risk for AD prior to frank cognitive decline and an AD diagnosis (McDonough and Allen, 2019). Seed and soil model of neurocognitive disorders: The seed and soil model of neurocognitive disorders (McDonough and Allen, 2019) was created to explain why some older adults who are predisposed to develop neurocognitive disorders, like AD, do not develop them even when surviving into late life (Figure 1). Specifically, it describes how one's lived environment and experiences throughout the life course set the stage for a toxic brain environment and greater susceptibility to pathology linked to AD later in life. Based on this model, the ""seed"" represents a predisposition to a neurocognitive disorder (e.g., genetic profile) and the ""soil"" refers to factors that moderate the expression of that seed. For example, the soil could be identified as the sum of lifetime exposures in one's physical, social, emotional, and cultural environments that contribute to non-genetic drivers of health (e.g., the exposome). Because the brain is a malleable organ, the external circumstances that comprise one's exposome can contribute to the disposition of the brain's microenvironment, and how it adapts to the consequences of such circumstances. An accumulation of negative circumstances can leave the brain vulnerable to the development of pathology such as amyloid-beta and tau, leading to progressive cognitive impairment and a diagnosis of AD. Critically, both the seed and the soil together determine whether an older adult will develop the disease. In its original form, this model did not address loneliness specifically, but the model is sufficiently general to apply new contexts as research and ideas evolve. As such, it might be the case that loneliness is one critical factor that can cause or accelerate the formation of brain pathology and thus, neurocognitive disorders later in life.Figure 1: Seed and soil model of neurocognitive disorders in relation to loneliness.Many factors in one's exposome (the soil) interact with one's predisposition to developing a neurocognitive disorder (the seed) to change the balance of neuroprotection vs. toxicity of the brain's micro-environment. Cumulative or persistent loneliness might serve as one critical negative factor in one's exposome that contributes to a toxic brain microenvironment. The more toxic the brain's micro-environment, the more vulnerable the brain is to pathogenesis, thus increasing the likelihood of the onset of a neurocognitive disorder, including Alzheimer's disease. To the extent that critical brain hubs like the DMN or connected regions like the entorhinal cortex are impacted, the higher the risk of such a disorder. A non-linear pattern of brain activation is hypothesized to occur in these early stages but with noticeable hyperactivity as an early indication of abnormal functioning. These brain structural and functional insults result in observable changes in cognition (e.g., episodic memory) and emotion (e.g., depression). Prevention of surpassing the disorder threshold can occur by (1) reducing the toxic brain load, (2) increasing neuroprotection, or (3) implementing interventions that strengthen the at-risk brain hubs. The brain map on the right side of the figure displays resting-state functional connectivity using the medial prefrontal cortex as a seed region to display the default mode network. Created with Microsoft PowerPoint.In addition to influencing the development of brain pathology, the model also predicts that brain regions with high metabolic consumption such as those found within the default mode network (including the hippocampus) should be at the earliest risk in those with negative exposomes. The model states that such accumulated risk would first manifest itself as hyperactivity (i.e., elevated activity or connectivity) using functional brain measures that would eventually turn into hypoactivity (or hypoconnectivity) and neurodegeneration in the same regions. Initial evidence for this model was provided by McDonough et al. (2019). Specifically, they found that dementia risk, as measured by multiple self-reported factors (e.g., education, hypertension, memory concerns) was associated with elevated brain activity in the default mode network and brain regions connected to this network (like the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus). However, this study did not include loneliness as a part of their dementia risk score. Impact of loneliness on the brain: According to the seed and soil model of neurocognitive disorders, factors across the life course may contribute to late-life brain alterations, either through an accumulation of insults or latent impacts. To better understand how loneliness might impact the brain, we briefly review studies across the adult life course. One of the first studies to investigate brain structural correlates of loneliness was in young adults. This study found that greater loneliness was associated with smaller white matter microstructure in brain regions involved in emotion processing (e.g., anterior insula) and parts of the default mode network (e.g., lateral parietal and temporal cortex; Nakagawa et al., 2015). Subsequent studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging focused on brain regions involved in emotional processing and also in younger adults (e.g., Inagaki et al., 2016). Inagaki et al. (2016) showed that greater loneliness was associated with greater brain activity in a combined region of interest of left and right caudate and putamen. These authors suggested that this hyperactivity might be due to a greater ""hunger"" for social connection. These findings suggest that loneliness can start to have an impact on brain structure and function early in the life course. Since those initial studies, research on the impact of loneliness on both brain structure and function has increased at a rapid rate. In one notable study consisting of over 40,000 middle-aged and older participants from the UK Biobank, the association with loneliness and the brain was tested across multiple MRI modalities (Spreng et al., 2020). Brain regions within the default network and limbic system reliably showed the strongest associations with brain structure and function. Notably, greater loneliness was associated with larger brain structures and more brain activity, suggesting a greater reliance on or upregulation of these networks. From this perspective, these findings might be consistent with the seed and soil model of neurocognitive disorders such that seemingly healthy middle-aged and older adults with a negative exposome appear to be first characterized by greater reliance on key brain hubs. Alternatively, these relationships might be characteristic of only normative or healthy aging. Brain function and structure in people on the pathway towards AD or related dementia might exhibit different relationships, especially in the presence of pathology. Indeed, research investigating middle-aged and older adults on the AD spectrum shows different results. Two studies took a region of interest approach in the temporal lobe given the previous link between loneliness and memory-related brain structures. For example, in the Alabama brain study on risk for dementia, middle-aged and older adults with greater loneliness showed lower gray matter density (as measured by voxel-based morphometry) in the entorhinal cortex (Apostolou et al., 2023). Similar results in the entorhinal cortex were found using voxel-based morphometry in a sample with cognitively normal and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (Imai et al., 2022). The significant relationship between the entorhinal cortex and loneliness is notable because this region was found to be associated with risk for AD (e.g., McDonough et al., 2019). The entorhinal cortex is one of the earliest brain regions to develop tau pathology and projects to the hippocampus, creating a clear pathway to impact both the hippocampus and the default mode network. Consistent with this notion, in vivo proxies for tau pathology in the entorhinal cortex have been associated with loneliness among cognitively normal older adults (for a review, see Lam et al., 2021). Similarly, some studies also have shown a relationship between in vivo proxies for beta-amyloid and loneliness among cognitively normal older adults (Lam et al., 2021). These studies support the possibility that loneliness plays an early role in increasing one's risk for AD through brain alterations. Although the aforementioned studies provide support for altered default mode network and limbic regions (as well as reward regions), more research is needed to understand the reliability of these effects. For example, a recent meta-analysis failed to find any association between loneliness and brain structure (Wong et al., 2022). In the same meta-analysis, loneliness was related to brain activity largely in the ventral attention and frontoparietal networks, as well as the default mode network. Thus, the default mode network is clearly not the only network to be impacted and may not even be the most strongly impacted by loneliness. Interestingly, this meta-analysis also revealed a large heterogeneity of effects with some studies showing positive associations with loneliness, some negative, and some null effects. As mentioned above, one possible explanation for the opposing direction of effects could be related to age (younger vs. older) and propensity to develop neurocognitive disorders like AD (i.e., having the ""seed""). Another explanation for some of the different associations across studies is that the samples might consist of different types of loneliness that often are not captured. For example, Tao et al. (2022) distinguished between different profiles of loneliness depending on their temporal consistency every five years across two to three time points. Middle-aged adults who expressed high levels of loneliness during at least two of the three time points were more likely to show a cognitive decline and lower temporal and hippocampal brain volume at their last time point relative to the non-lonely group. Similarly, an analysis showing the accumulation of loneliness across the three time points resulted in the strongest associations with brain structure. In contrast, middle-aged adults who showed transient/incidental loneliness at just one of the time points did not differ from non-lonely adults in cognition or brain structure. Thus, cross-sectional studies are unable to tease apart transient from persistent loneliness unless measured across multiple time points retrospectively, which is uncommon. The seed and soil model of neurocognitive disorders emphasizes the accumulation of life experiences across time that should give rise to the greatest brain vulnerabilities rather than single incidents. Concluding remarks: While previous research has demonstrated that loneliness can have deleterious effects on health, its relation to brain health and the development of neurocognitive disorders is still in its infancy. Although additional research is necessary to clarify the reason for heterogeneous patterns related to loneliness, the evidence of the science thus far suggests that multiple brain networks are impacted across the life course both in health and pathology. This information can provide further support to guide clinicians on how to educate their patients on the importance of maintaining social relationships throughout their lives. Recommendations to improve social connection include engaging in volunteer activities, recreational activities, scheduling regular activities with friends and family, engaging with your neighbors and community, and simply getting out of the house and into environments with other people present. While such recommendations can improve social engagement directly, other interventions aimed at targeting the brain regions impacted by loneliness might minimize brain atrophy or even restore brain functioning in downstream regions affected by loneliness, as proposed by McDonough and Allen (2019). Such attempts could be implemented via neurostimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial electric stimulation. Additional methods include implementing cognitive or behavioral interventions that have reliably been shown to impact brain regions within the temporal lobe and default mode network.

Evidence from twin studies suggests that memory is mainly influenced by genetics. Moreover, a few twin studies have demonstrated genetic overlap between specific memory functions and schizophrenia. Memory deficits in schizophrenia seem to involve abnormalities in frontal cortical areas and the middle temporal lobe, particularly the hippocampus. In the general population, twin studies have consistently demonstrated genetic influences on brain volumes, however, evidence from twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia suggests that hippocampus volumes may be more susceptible to environmental effects in patients.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>;                <jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>Twin pairs concordant or discordant for a diagnosis in the schizophrenia spectrum were recruited nation-wide by linking The Danish Twin Register and The Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register.

A total of 216 twins participated in this study consisting of 32 complete MZ and 24 complete DZ proband pairs, 29 complete MZ and 20 complete DZ HC pairs, and six twins from proband pairs were included without their sibling. Verbal memory was assessed using the list learning task from the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS), visual memory using the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) and associative memory using 15 word pairs. Structural brain scans were acquired with T1-weighted sequence on a Philips 3.0 T Achieva MRI scanner with a 32-channel SENSE head coil. Images were processed using FreeSurfer (version 5.3) and the Desikan-Killiany atlas was used to extract the volumes of bilateral hippocampi, superior frontal, rostral and caudal middle frontal cortices as well as the whole brain volume. Structural equation modelling was applied to examine the genetic and environmental contributions to the variability in memory and brain measures and to quantify associations with schizophrenia spectrum liability.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>;                <jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>Results</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>Significant heritability estimates were observed for verbal memory (h2=0.53), visual memory (h2=0.58) and associative memory (immediate h2=0.33, delayed h2=0.54), whereas the copy and recognition task from RCFT were only explained by unique environmental factors. Except for verbal memory, all memory measures were significantly associated with schizophrenia spectrum liability, and these were mainly due to overlapping genetic factors. Genetic factors also significantly contributed to whole brain (h2=0.36), right superior frontal (h2=0.48), left rostral middle frontal (h2=0.40) and hippocampus volumes (right h2=0.29, left h2=0.50). Common environmental factors significantly influenced whole brain (c2=0.51), right hippocampus (c2=0.51) and right rostral middle frontal (c2=0.47) volumes. Hippocampus volumes were significantly associated with schizophrenia spectrum liability, and for the left hippocampus this association was due to overlapping genetic factors.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>;                <jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>Discussion</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>Specific memory measures and related brain areas were heritable, providing further evidence of the importance of genetics in memory functioning. Furthermore, the majority of the applied memory measures and left hippocampal volume were (genetically) associated with schizophrenia spectrum liability, suggesting a partially shared etiology. The heritable memory measures and related brain areas showing associations with disease may represent endophenotypes for schizophrenia spectrum disorders. In future analyses, we plan to examine the covariance between memory, brain volumes and schizophrenia.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>",46,Supplement_1,S254,S254,Psychology; Twin study; Cognitive psychology; Memory functions; Schizophrenia spectrum,,,,,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1462435-genetic-influences-on-memory-functions-and-related-brain-structures-and-associations-with-schizophrenia-spectrum-disorders--a-nation-wide-twin-study https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article-abstract/46/Supplement_1/S254/5839387 https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/273884,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbaa029.620,,10.1093/schbul/sbaa029.620,3028240376,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc,hybrid
136-327-153-210-006,Examining stability of machine learning methods for predicting dementia at early phases of the disease,,2022,journal article,Decision Science Letters,19295804; 19295812,Growing Science,Canada,Sinan Faouri; Mahmood AlBashayreh; Mohammad Azzeh,"<jats:p>Dementia is a neuropsychiatric brain disorder that usually occurs when one or more brain cells stop working partially or at all. Diagnosis of this disorder in the early phases of the disease is a vital task to rescue patients’ lives from bad consequences and provide them with better healthcare. Machine learning methods have been proven to be accurate in predicting dementia in the early phases of the disease. The prediction of dementia depends heavily on the type of collected data which usually are gathered from Normalized Whole Brain Volume (nWBV) and Atlas Scaling Factor (ASF) which are normally measured and corrected from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs). Other biological features such as age and gender can also help in the diagnosis of dementia. Although many studies use machine learning for predicting dementia, we could not reach a conclusion on the stability of these methods for which one is more accurate under different experimental conditions. Therefore, this paper investigates the conclusion stability regarding the performance of machine learning algorithms for dementia prediction. To accomplish this, a large number of experiments were run using 7 machine learning algorithms and two feature reduction algorithms namely, Information Gain (IG) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To examine the stability of these algorithms, thresholds of feature selection were changed for the IG from 20% to 100% and the PCA dimension from 2 to 8. This has resulted in 7×9 + 7×7= 112 experiments. In each experiment, various classification evaluation data were recorded. The obtained results show that among seven algorithms the support vector machine and Naïve Bayes are the most stable algorithms while changing the selection threshold. Also, it was found that using IG would seem more efficient than using PCA for predicting Dementia. These promising results open the door to a new era of early prognosis of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD).</jats:p>",,,333,346,Dementia; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Stability (learning theory); Principal component analysis; Feature selection; Computer science; Dimensionality reduction; Feature (linguistics); Disease; Algorithm; Medicine; Linguistics; Philosophy; Pathology,,,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.04643 http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04643,http://dx.doi.org/10.5267/j.dsl.2022.1.005,,10.5267/j.dsl.2022.1.005,,,0,136-327-153-210-006,3,true,cc-by,gold

The neuropsychological battery of the Uniform Data Set (UDSNB3.0) assesses cognition in ageing and dementia, by measuring scores across different cognitive domains such as attention, memory, processing speed, executive function and language.

AD participants with a Medial Temporal Atrophy scale of higher than 2 on 3T MRI were excluded from the study.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">A significant difference in the entire hippocampal volume was observed in the AD group compared to healthy controls (HC), primarily influenced by CA1, the largest hippocampal subfield. Notably, no significant difference in whole brain volume between the groups implied that hippocampal volume loss was not merely reflective of overall brain atrophy. UDSNB3.0 cognitive scores showed significant differences between AD and HC, particularly in Memory, Language, and Visuospatial domains. The volume of the Dentate Gyrus (DG) showed a significant association with the Memory and Executive domain scores in AD patients as assessed by the UDSNB3.0.. The data also suggested a non-significant trend for CA1 volume associated with UDSNB3.0 Memory, Executive, and Language domain scores in AD. In a reassessment focusing on hippocampal subfields and MoCA memory subdomains in AD, associations were observed between the DG and Cued, Uncued, and Recognition Memory subscores, whereas CA1 and Tail showed associations only with Cued memory.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This study reveals differences in the hippocampal volumes measured using 7T MRI, between individuals with early symptomatic AD compared with healthy controls.

143-214-114-261-604,Size matters?,,2008,editorial,Journal of hypertension,02636352; 14735598,Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health),United States,John Webster,"With the increasing longevity of ‘westernized’ populations, cognitive decline and associated dementia has become a problem of growing scale and complexity. Affected individuals suffer impaired quality of life; friends, relatives and carers suffer years of distress and exhaustion; and health services struggle to cope with the resource implications. Alzheimer's disease and multiinfarct disease are the two commonest forms, although there is considerable overlap and mixed patterns are not infrequent. Both these forms are associated with hypertension. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLBs) is the second commonest degenerative form and is less clearly associated with hypertension. In the case of vascular dementia (VaD), hypertension is an important, if not dominant, predisposing factor. Large cortical infarcts are known to affect speech, comprehension, visiospatial skills and higher executive function. In these patients, cognitive impairment may often be overshadowed by the major residual neurological deficits of aphasia, apraxia and sensorimotor impairment and may even go unrecognized or underestimated. Small vessel disease– often resulting in subcortical lacunes– may result in less dramatic neurological deficits but when recurrent may result in extensive white matter change and severe progressive cognitive impairment. ‘Silent’ subcortical brain ischaemia may also accrue in the periventricular white matter, with or without lacunar disease, and is particularly associated with lipohyalinosis of small penetrating arteries in elderly hypertensive patients. None of these patterns is mutually exclusive. Two interesting subsets of VaD are characterized by distinctive histopathology. In cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), amyloid accumulates in cerebral arterioles and predisposes to multiple haemorrhages, infarctions, ischaemic white matter damage and cognitive impairment [1]. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADISIL) produces a syndrome of migraine, extensive lacunar infarction and white matter ischaemia, occurring in a strong familial pattern [2]. From all these and other observations, it is increasingly clear that dementia or cognitive decline is a very complex process with powerful genetic, vascular and degenerative elements. Not only is there a wide spectrum of underlying disorder, but it also seems apparent that clinical features may vary between one pattern of dementia and another. Memory loss is a prominent early feature of Alzheimer's disease, for example, whereas this may appear as a later feature of patients with VaD. In general, the volume of damaged brain tissue is linked to the development of dementia [3]. However, the regional distribution of brain disorder is also critical. In patients developing dementia from cortical strokes, the resulting clinical picture will be strongly influenced by the particular brain region affected; frontal lobe lesions commonly being associated with apathy, loss of executive function and personality change, left temporoparietal lobe lesions with aphasia, acalculia and loss of sense of direction, and right parietal lobe lesions with visiospatial apraxia, anosognosia, etc. Subcortical syndromes also reflect the underlying damaged neural pathways, and may include Parkinsonian features, gait disturbance and emotional lability. Establishing links between hypertension and cognitive impairment has been more difficult than establishing links with stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). Cognitive impairment is a semiquantitative trait rather than a discrete variable and it has taken some time to establish a widely recognized valid measurement tool. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the most widely used scale and is reasonably robust and standardized, and may be enhanced by addition of criteria such as the Hachinski score [4] or DSM-IV [5,6] to help distinguish VaD from Alzheimer's disease. As dementia progresses, one of the common clinical features is apathy for food and resultant weight loss, which may be accompanied by a significant fall in blood pressure (BP). Some forms of dementia may be accompanied by autonomic dysfunction and resultant BP changes. The net effect is that the BP at the time of diagnosis may be much lower than in the earlier years of subclinical progression of cognitive decline [7]. Cross-sectional data on BP may thus fail to reflect the true association with the evolution of the disease process. Furthermore, ‘spot’ measurements of BP suffer from sampling errors– this may be one area in which ambulatory BP measurements may offer some advantages. A number of studies have indeed reported that midlife vascular risk factors, including BP, may be associated with dementia later in life [8,9], and that markers of vascular stiffness may antedate cognitive decline [10,11]. Lowering BP in patients with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (using indapamide and perindopril) reduces the risk of subsequent stroke [12]. An underestimated benefit of such treatment is the concomitant reduction in cognitive decline– principally mediated by prevention of recurrent strokes [13]. Even before this evidence emerged, it had been suggested that BP reduction in patients with isolated systolic hypertension (using nitrendipine as first line) also reduced the incidence of dementia and cognitive decline [14]. In this case, the main effect seemed to be prevention of Alzheimer's disease. Prevention of Alzheimer's disease had not been observed in either the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) study [15] in a similar group of patients treated with diuretic as first line, or in the Medical Research Council (MRC) elderly hypertension trial [16] using atenolol or thiazide as first line therapy, raising the possibility that a treatment-specific effect may have accounted for the difference. A prespecified outcome analysis of the Study on COgnition and Prognosis in the Elderly (SCOPE) trial [17], using candesartan as first line therapy, did not show a difference in cognitive function compared with placebo, though a post-hoc analysis in patients with mildly impaired MMSE scores at baseline suggested a modest benefit [18]. Recently, the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) [19] in hypertensive patients over the age of 80 years was stopped early because of a highly significant benefit of active medication (indapamide and perindopril versus placebo) on stroke. All cause mortality and other major cardiovascular endpoints were also substantially reduced. The results of cognitive function studies in this trial are awaited with interest. Clearly, the implications of these observations are very considerable in respect of both primary and secondary prevention of cognitive decline. Is BP reduction really beneficial? If so, is the mechanism related purely to prevention of recurrent stroke? Is there a differential drug effect on cognition that might relate to the mode of action of the antihypertensive drug? That is not too fanciful, given recent evidence suggesting that for a given reduction in BP, antihypertensives, alone or in combination, may have differential effects not just on major outcomes but also on glucose tolerance [20], regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) [21], development of new onset atrial fibrillation [22] and improvement in proteinuria [23]. This is clearly an important area for future research, though outcome studies are difficult to perform because of the magnitude of any effect, the lack of precision and predictive power of surrogate measures and the need for long-term follow-up. Mechanistic studies exploring the association between BP, cognitive function and neuropathology are therefore of considerable interest. In this month's issue, Nagai et al. [24] report that ambulatory BP is an independent determinant of brain atrophy and cognitive function in elderly hypertensives. Their main conclusion is that ‘nondippers’ appear to have smaller brain volumes and lower cognitive function scores. In multiple linear regression analysis, mean nighttime systolic blood pressure (SBP) bore the closest (negative) association with total brain volume and MMSE score. Their study had four main elements; patients, ambulatory BP measurement, cognitive assessment and neuroimaging, and each merits some scrutiny. They studied 55 untreated hypertensive patients over the age of 70 years. However, the mean clinic BP was 148/82 mmHg so that these were mainly patients with mild systolic hypertension. Their method of ambulatory BP recording (TM-2421 or TM-2425) is reasonably robust and well validated. Measurement was undertaken only once, and this suffers from limited reproducibility, including assessment of the dipping pattern [25]. The authors define ‘sleep’ as the time between going to bed and waking up. Not everyone sleeps undisturbed [26] and it is possible that patients with evolving cognitive impairment may have disturbed sleep pattern as an early feature, which might then lead to higher night-time pressure. The study did not investigate sleep patterns and it would be prudent to refer to ‘overnight’ rather than ‘sleep’ BP. Their method of ascertaining cognitive function– MMSE [5] is a validated and internationally recognized standard, though it may be more valuable in assessing change over time rather than as a cross-sectional tool. Sixteen of their patients had an MMSE of less than 25, and some of these may have had mild dementia, though none fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for this. Their method of assessing brain atrophy was by MRI using a 1.5 T scanner and T1-weighted spoiled gradient recalled-echo (SPGR) images for the whole brain in the coronal plane to obtain total brain mass [27]. Although the technique is well established and was conducted by a single experienced observer with good internal reproducibility, the method is rather old and gives no information about brain substructures, grey and white matter differentiation or quantification of lacunar disease. Voxel-based morphometry [28] might be a more informative method. Recent studies have shown not only the effects of normal ageing [29] but also patterns of atrophy in Alzheimer's disease [30], and a distinct pattern of focal atrophy in DLBs that can be distinguished from Alzheimer's disease [31]. The proportion of the intracranial cavity occupied by the brain and volume of white matter hyperintensities may independently predict progression of cognitive decline [32]. What's done is done. As it stands the paper (admittedly derived from a small cohort) adds to the literature linking hypertension with cognitive impairment. Mean nighttime SBP has previously been shown to be linked more strongly with major cardiovascular outcomes than 24 h or daytime means or clinic BP [33]. Is this a general phenomenon that extends to brain volume or the consequence of some linked mechanism? This cross-sectional study does not exclude the possibility that some influence in earlier life– for example intrauterine growth retardation– might predispose to both hypertension and smaller brain volume. The brain imaging data are of interest, though in a limited way, and more sophisticated imaging modalities need to be explored. Albert Einstein died in 1955 at the age of 76 years of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. I am unaware if he was hypertensive, though it seems very probable. He was mentally alert to his final day. His brain was removed at autopsy, measured, fixed and examined in detail. No abnormality was found, but a subsequent detailed review [34] of the autopsy material made some interesting observations suggesting a unique morphology of his left inferior parietal lobule, with a distinctive variation in the Sylvian fissure and supramarginal gyrus. Total brain volume was not measured but his overall brain weight was no different from normal. Einstein embraced the medical technology of his day, volunteering for electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in the interests of neurological research. One can imagine his enthusiasm for modern neuroimaging; what he would have made of a mini-mental examination is another story.",26,8,1548,1550,Medicine; Dementia; Apraxia; Cerebral amyloid angiopathy; White matter; Hyperintensity; Aphasia; Cognition; Cognitive decline; Disease; Atrophy; Pathology; Cardiology; Neuroscience; Psychiatry; Magnetic resonance imaging; Psychology; Radiology,,Brain/pathology; Brain Infarction/pathology; Cognition Disorders/pathology; Dementia/pathology; Humans; Hypertension/pathology,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0b013e328307a095,18622229,10.1097/hjh.0b013e328307a095,,,0,001-168-112-394-936; 004-449-160-638-069; 006-321-496-790-291; 007-248-188-099-704; 007-448-957-039-64X; 008-461-856-882-884; 009-403-757-127-032; 009-969-458-637-457; 010-884-978-734-229; 012-019-370-632-036; 014-005-506-405-015; 015-396-427-880-202; 016-230-218-438-692; 016-727-854-787-782; 016-873-883-515-239; 018-695-689-415-561; 018-922-531-149-512; 022-988-712-445-94X; 028-092-620-681-386; 028-456-062-569-57X; 030-916-767-225-693; 031-471-599-749-11X; 036-717-379-315-298; 038-695-280-115-745; 042-525-715-397-589; 049-122-343-542-287; 062-755-236-422-766; 068-214-132-858-748; 077-660-240-927-866; 098-833-861-155-461; 103-881-360-136-073; 109-855-945-478-596; 125-265-134-404-518,1,true,,bronze

Carmichael; Dan Mungas; Laurel Beckett; Danielle Harvey; Sarah T. Farias; Bruce Reed; John Olichney; Joshua Miller; Charles DeCarli,"MRI measures of brain structure have been shown to predict conversion to dementia in clinic-based samples, but their utility for predicting conversion in combination with other established risk factors in a diverse community setting remains unclear. Therefore we assessed whether MRI-based measures of brain volume (BV), hippocampal volume (HC), and white matter hyperintensity volume (WMH) predicted risk of dementia in a heterogeneous cohort after accounting for demographic variables, psychometrically matched cognitive measures, APOE genotype, and baseline clinical diagnosis. 289 community-dwelling non-demented participants in the University of California, Davis Alzheimer's Disease Center Longitudinal cohort received MRI, cognitive testing, and clinical evaluation at baseline, and follow-up clinical evaluations at yearly follow-ups. Participants were highly diverse in terms of ethnicity (Caucasian, Hispanic, and African-American), early life experiences, cardiovascular health, socioeconomic status, and other factors. Sequentially-constructed Cox proportional hazard models analyzed the independent contributions of the MRI variables, age, gender, education, ethnicity, APOE genotype, baseline clinical diagnosis (including MCI subtypes), and psychometrically-matched measures of semantic memory, episodic memory, executive function, and visuospatial function for increasing or decreasing risk of dementia diagnosis on follow-up. BV, WMH, semantic memory, APOE genotype, and baseline clinical diagnosis were each independently associated with increased risk of dementia after accounting for other demographic and cognitive variables and HC. Even after controlling for several other established risk factors for dementia, MRI provides independent power to predict dementia in a heterogeneous community cohort. The utility of MRI for predicting dementia may generalize well to a diverse community setting.",6,4S_Part_10,,,Dementia; Cohort; Psychology; Gerontology; Medicine; Internal medicine; Clinical psychology; Disease,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1016/j.jalz.2010.05.960 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2010.05.960,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2010.05.960,,10.1016/j.jalz.2010.05.960,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

It typically manifests during adulthood, but in approximately 5% of cases, the disease occurs in minors, referred to as juvenile-onset HD (JHD).1 JHD patients have a distinct clinical presentation often with early cognitive changes, Parkinsonism and epilepsy in patients with childhood-onset and early cognitive and psychiatric disturbances in adolescent-onset disease.2, 3 HD neuropathology is characterised by atrophy, as revealed by a reduction in brain volume, neuronal cell loss and reactive changes in astro- and oligodendroglia. These changes are most prominent in the neostriatum (e.g. caudate nucleus and putamen), following a caudo-rostral gradient with disease progression but extend to other brain regions (e.g. globus pallidus, [hypo]thalamus, cortex, brain stem and cerebellum) as well. Neostriatal findings are formulated in the five-scale Vonsattel grading system,4 a measure of neuropathological severity. End-stage neuropathology in JHD cases is generally more severe than in adult-onset cases.3, 5 Reductions in brain volume and in the volume of specified regions are also apparent in in vivo imaging studies in HD patients,6 yet a comparison of post-mortem imaging and neuropathological findings at the same time point in the same patient is lacking. Furthermore, the majority of post-mortem studies are performed on end-stage disease. Therefore, an exploration of the relationship between early clinical characteristics and neuropathological grading in HD brain donors who died after a short disease duration has not been undertaken. Here, we report a case study of a JHD brain donor with a moderate clinical disease burden and short clinical disease duration. Ex vivo, in situ ultrahigh field 7T MR imaging revealed bilateral atrophy of the neostriatum, most significantly of the putamen. Neuropathological assessment revealed sparse neuronal loss and limited gliosis of the same regions, in keeping with Vonsattel grade 1. This case report highlights the risk of underestimating neuropathological severity by Vonsattel grading, due to undervaluation of neuropathological changes outside the head of the caudate nucleus (HCN). Atrophy of the putamen was pronounced in this case; therefore, the entirety of the neuropathological findings should always be taken into account in HD brain donors that did not reach end-stage disease. Studies like these increase our understanding of how early clinical disease characteristics and imaging are related to neuropathological changes and grading and vice versa. The patient was a man who died at 21 years of age by legally approved euthanasia. He was clinically diagnosed with HD at 19 years of age, therefore referred to as juvenile- (adolescent) onset HD.2, 3 Molecular analysis of the HTT gene revealed a pathologically expanded CAG repeat of 57. The earliest symptom of his disease was learning difficulty and this developed 2 years before diagnosis. The patient had a moderate clinical disease burden shortly before death. Clinical characteristics included moderate/common generalised chorea and truncal dystonia, ataxia, balance disorder, mild dysarthria, dysphagia, mild dysexecutive disorder and frequent irritative and aggressive outbursts. Clinical Global Impression of Severity was scored from 4 to 5 on a 7-point scale (e.g. 1; not at all ill to 7; extremely ill).7 Functional disabilities were mild to moderate, including the inability to work, and needing assistance in domestic chores. Patient independence was scored as stage 2 using the Shoulson–Fahn ranking system and a total functional capacity of 6.8 The short disease duration of 4 years was paralleled by a moderate CAG-Age Product score of 490, a measure of disease progression.9 The patient and his relatives gave informed consent for brain autopsy, post-mortem MRI and the pseudonymized use of clinical characteristics and brain tissue for research purposes and publication. The study followed the tenants of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ex vivo, in situ ultrahigh field 7T MR brain imaging was performed within 3 h post-mortem delay (PMD) and brain autopsy and dissection within 11 h PMD. Brain dissection was performed following a standard protocol.10 By radiological assessment, the donor had severe bilateral atrophy of the putamen and slight to moderate atrophy of the HCN, which was best appreciated at the dorsal side of the caudate head (Figure 1A,C). We could not reliably determine if there was atrophy in the body and tail of the caudate nucleus due to their small size, and therefore, we could not confidently determine if there was a gradient in the caudate nucleus degeneration. There were no signs of atrophy outside the neostriatum. By brain autopsy, gross brain weight was 1480 g (normal for this age and sex). The neuropathological assessment revealed no macroscopic evidence of atrophy with a normal contour of the HCN into the lateral ventricles (Figure 1D). Microscopically, the HCN and rostral putamen revealed a normal density of neuronal cell bodies and no signs of astrogliosis (Figure 1E). In the body of the caudate nucleus (BCN; at height of the anterior thalamus), there was a minor loss of neurones and gliosis (Figure 1F). We were not able to microscopically assess the tail of the caudate nucleus in the histopathological sections that were available. Neuronal loss was most prominent in the caudal putamen, including a mild degree of gliosis (Figure 1G). These findings are consistent with a Vonsattel grade 1. Cell distribution and morphology in other striatal and cortical regions appeared normal. Immunohistochemistry for mutant-Huntingtin revealed scattered nuclear aggregates in neurons of the frontal lobe, caudate nucleus and putamen (Figure 1H). Several conclusions can be drawn from this illustrative case report. This patient had a characteristic adolescent-onset HD presentation with cognitive onset of disease, severe psychiatric disturbances and a motor phenotype including ataxia, dystonia and chorea. This moderate disease burden, combined with mild to moderate functional disability and short disease duration, is paralleled by mild neuronal cell loss and gliosis of the neostriatum, which was most prominent in the caudal putamen, without evident cell loss and gliosis in other brain regions. More prominent atrophy of the putamen, as compared with the caudate nucleus, in early HD stages, has been mentioned in the literature before.11 The discrepancy between moderate disease burden and mild neuropathology most likely relates to the notion that disease burden is primarily caused by neuronal dysfunction and only secondary by neuronal loss.12 Furthermore, the presence of neuronal mHTT aggregates in our donor with a relatively high CAG repeat length, and short disease duration is in line with former studies revealing mHTT aggregates even in pre-symptomatic HD brain donors and correlating with CAG repeat length.13, 14 Severe macroscopic atrophy of the putamen was best appreciated via imaging and confirmed by the microscopic finding that the most prominent neuronal cell loss and reactive gliosis was in this region. Neuropathology in the putamen followed a caudal-rostral gradient with the most severe neuronal loss in the caudal putamen, at the level of the thalamus and less neuronal change in the rostral putamen at the level of the nucleus accumbens. This case highlights possible undervaluation of neuropathological severity since Vonsattel grading is mostly defined by macroscopic volume loss of the HCN (rostral neostriatum) in the lateral ventricle, a change that is usually appreciated only in later stages of the disease. Consideration of macroscopic atrophy of the putamen on coronal sectioning, particularly in HD donors that have not progressed to end-stage disease, is therefore warranted. Further multimodal (i.e., clinical, functional, imaging and neuropathology) studies are needed in HD brain donors with relatively short disease duration, in order to improve understanding of how various HD measures relate to one and another and to improve the use of diagnostic, grading and staging criteria in HD. We would like to express our gratitude to the donor, relatives and all others who made this study possible. The authors declare to have no conflict of interest with the presented findings.

Barkana,"Alzheimer's (AD) is the most common form of dementia that negatively affects memory, thinking, behavior, and intellectual abilities in one's daily life. The risk of AD increases with age 65 and older although it may appear in people who are in their 40s or 50s. AD has no current cure. There are many ongoing research studies to understanding and treating this disease better. AD, a slowly progressive brain disease, begins well before clinical symptoms emerge. A diagnosis of AD is usually made by primary care physicians based on patient's medical and family history, psychiatric history, and history of cognitive and behavioral changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most common imaging modality to use to identify brain changes. In this study, MRI scans of 10 individuals without AD and 10 individuals with AD are compared and analyzed based on brain volume. Measurements included the occipital lobe and hippocampal.",3,,1,6,Magnetic resonance imaging; Cognition; Occipital lobe; Disease; Dementia; Psychiatric history; Family history; Brain size; Medicine; Physical medicine and rehabilitation,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7160197/ http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7160197/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/lisat.2015.7160197,,10.1109/lisat.2015.7160197,1580150121,,2,000-844-180-256-919; 004-031-312-182-139; 004-649-811-516-652; 005-233-603-896-969; 011-041-990-275-37X; 013-874-665-128-711; 014-946-471-706-102; 019-099-274-334-634; 028-295-203-211-113; 041-909-612-890-326; 042-694-790-312-642; 044-701-618-775-51X; 051-518-328-589-362; 051-649-464-394-009; 051-668-881-841-977; 063-548-529-386-564; 065-947-594-817-237; 068-334-828-796-158; 083-734-458-814-57X; 086-064-909-722-586; 087-068-978-281-782; 101-204-228-745-508; 117-251-058-313-675; 153-705-536-256-644,4,false,,

A support-vector machine (SVM) is one of the machine learning techniques, which may be utilized as a classifier for various classification problems. This study exploratorily investigated the accuracy of SVM classification models for AD subjects using brain volume and various clinical data as features. Methods: The study was designed as a retrospective chart review. A total of 201 eligible subjects were recruited from the Memory Clinic at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand. Eighteen cases were excluded due to incomplete MRI data. Subjects were randomly assigned to a training group (AD = 46, normal = 46) and testing group (AD = 45, normal = 46) for SVM modeling and validation, respectively. The results in terms of accuracy and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis are reported. Results: The highest accuracy for brain volumetry (62.64%) was found using the hippocampus as a single feature. A combination of clinical parameters as features provided accuracy ranging between 83 and 90%. However, a combination of brain volumetry and clinical parameters as features to the SVM models did not improve the accuracy of the result. Conclusions: In our study, the use of brain volumetry as SVM features provided low classification accuracy with the highest accuracy of 62.64% using the hippocampus volume alone. In contrast, the use of clinical parameters [Thai mental state examination score, controlled oral word association tests (animals; and letters K, S, and P), learning memory, clock-drawing test, and construction-praxis] as features for SVM models provided good accuracy between 83 and 90%.",12,,640696,640696,Support vector machine; Artificial intelligence; Pattern recognition; Memory clinic; Classifier (linguistics); Volume (compression); Receiver operating characteristic; Contrast (statistics); Brain size; Medicine; Feature (computer vision),Alzheimer disease; Thailand; machine learning; support vector machine; volumetric MRI,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.640696/full http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34040575 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8141708 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34040575 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34040575 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34040575/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.640696,34040575,10.3389/fneur.2021.640696,3162666359,PMC8141708,0,001-400-302-641-954; 006-357-200-870-597; 008-874-735-021-290; 012-581-225-897-976; 017-608-458-904-654; 018-189-613-658-047; 033-253-770-689-477; 033-280-527-610-128; 033-764-834-264-262; 046-109-308-014-942; 046-930-206-024-615; 055-463-120-000-686; 068-078-740-056-69X; 073-955-089-379-758; 079-204-460-064-373; 081-709-073-312-336; 082-380-167-450-006; 083-487-119-817-13X; 086-553-125-974-694; 090-917-665-223-022; 107-131-729-782-984; 114-303-184-646-553,22,true,cc-by,gold

Hayes; Jasmeet P. Hayes; Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative,"Background A complex set of interactions between biological, genetic, and environmental factors likely underlies the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying which of these factors is most associated with AD is important for early diagnosis and treatment. Objective We sought to examine genetic risk and structural brain volume on episodic memory in a sample of older adults ranging from cognitively normal to those diagnosed with AD. Methods 686 adults (55-91 years old) completed a 3T MRI scan, baseline cognitive assessments, and biospecimen collection through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Hierarchical linear regression analyses examined main and interaction effects of medial temporal lobe (MTL) volume and polygenic hazard score (PHS), indicating genetic risk for AD, on a validated episodic memory composite score. Results Genetic risk moderated the relationship between MTL volume and memory, such that individuals with high PHS and lower hippocampal and entorhinal volume had lower memory composite scores [ΔF (1,677) = 4.057, p = 0.044, ΔR2 = 0.002]. Further analyses showed this effect was driven by the left hippocampus [ΔF(1,677) = 5.256, p = 0.022, ΔR2 = 0.003] and right entorhinal cortex [ΔF (1,677) = 6.078, p = 0.014, ΔR2 = 0.003]. Conclusions Among those with high genetic risk for AD, lower volume was associated with poorer memory. Results suggest that the interaction between AD genetic risk and MTL volume increases the likelihood for memory impairment among older adults. Results from this study suggest that genetic risk and brain volume should be considered key factors in tracking cognitive decline.",76,2,591,600,Cognition; Entorhinal cortex; Temporal lobe; Hippocampus; Cognitive decline; Memory impairment; Audiology; Brain size; Medicine; Episodic memory,Alzheimer’s disease; atrophy; entorhinal cortex; episodic memory; hippocampus; medial temporal lobe; polygenic risk,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease/diagnostic imaging; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Male; Memory, Episodic; Middle Aged; Organ Size/physiology; Positron-Emission Tomography/methods; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Temporal Lobe/diagnostic imaging",,NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG058822) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R21 AG056921) United States; NIA NIH HHS (U01 AG024904) United States,https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad191312 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32538837 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32538837 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32538837/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/jad-191312,32538837,10.3233/jad-191312,3035293809,PMC7558431,0,001-595-533-823-694; 002-728-393-618-383; 003-248-637-497-498; 011-082-331-917-210; 011-686-765-009-604; 012-893-668-366-907; 013-823-550-061-932; 014-731-534-045-543; 017-668-673-488-280; 020-439-430-668-665; 020-798-450-711-581; 024-997-752-988-612; 026-119-065-307-639; 026-744-790-713-553; 034-145-754-743-021; 040-824-325-494-284; 041-000-880-143-832; 043-134-967-618-120; 043-272-330-514-653; 045-316-698-813-365; 045-393-538-537-866; 046-861-213-660-939; 052-690-172-487-095; 068-910-533-634-744; 074-739-085-821-289; 075-135-173-526-668; 077-273-307-091-97X; 079-464-276-519-332; 081-920-327-522-370; 083-325-270-572-831; 087-545-297-289-85X; 090-587-633-344-779; 093-126-482-671-955; 096-812-021-278-340; 109-549-459-933-893; 116-965-385-292-136; 121-999-048-619-739; 127-546-663-304-735,1,true,,green

As part of the original study, participants received a thorough clinical assessment for FASD as well as an MRI brain scan. The participants represented three groups:22 adults with fetal alcohol syndrome—defined as the presence of central nervous system dysfunction, growth deficits, and sentinel facial features of prenatal alcohol exposure.18 adults with fetal alcohol effects—defined as the presence of some, but not all, characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome.26 adults with no history of prenatal alcohol exposure.The researchers performed another MRI scan and found the same pattern of brain volume differences as had been observed previously: Average total intracranial brain volume as well as the volume of specific regions such as the cerebellum were much larger in the control group than the group with fetal alcohol syndrome; the brain volumes of those with fetal alcohol effects were in between the control group and fetal alcohol syndrome group.The researchers found no evidence of any accelerated brain aging or reversal of brain volume deficits in the two groups with prenatal alcohol exposure over the two time points.“There is a critical need to extend the longitudinal assessment of this cohort into older ages when clearer signs of accelerated aging might manifest morphologically to track whether the FASD population is at heightened risk for premature or exacerbated dementia or other disorders of aging,” the researchers wrote.Pfefferbaum A, Sullivan EV, Pohl KM, et al.

Researchers Develop Mouse VR Goggles to Aid Brain ResearchDom Pinke/Northwestern UniversityInvestigators at Northwestern University and colleagues have designed a set of virtual reality (VR) goggles for mice. As detailed in Neuron, the researchers hope these goggles can recreate the animal’s natural environments and enhance the study of the brain circuits underlying behaviors such as fear and anxiety.Current methods of creating virtual environments for mice involve placing mice on treadmills surrounded by computer monitors or projection screens. Such approaches do not fully encompass the large field of view that mice possess.Like human VR systems, the Miniature Rodent Stereo Illumination VR (iMRSIV) system provide a 180-degree field of view, removing all external content. (The goggles do not wrap around the mouse but rather sit over the eyes when the mouse is fixed on the treadmill.)The investigators found that mice that used the iMRSIV system learned and mastered virtual tasks (for example, running down a linear track to get water) more quickly than mice using a monitor-based VR system. In addition, the investigators were able to induce intrinsic freezing and fleeing behaviors in iMRSIV mice by creating overhead shadows, something traditional VR systems cannot do.Finally, the iMRSIV setup enabled the investigators to position a photon microscope over the mouse’s head while they performed tasks. By injecting the mice with a marker that made neurons in the hippocampus fluorescent, they were able to see which hippocampal neurons became activated as the mice navigated and entered new environments.The investigators noted several limitations of the iMRSIV system, including the contact between the goggles and the animal’s whiskers (which affects their behavior).“[W]ith future miniaturization, goggles small and light enough to be carried by a freely moving mouse might be achievable,” the authors wrote. “Such a system could be used for augmented visual reality paradigms in which the other senses, including self-motion cues, are preserved.”Pinke D, Issa JB, Dara GAet al.

E-Cigarette Dependence May Increase Risk of DepressionGetty Images/iStock/Vladyslav HoroshevychYouth and young adults who are dependent on e-cigarettes may be more likely to develop depressive symptoms than those who are not dependent on e-cigarettes, reports a study in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine.“Notably, the results were not bidirectional, that is, depression scores, after controlling for potential covariates, and depressive symptoms did not predict changes in vaping dependence,” wrote the researchers from the University of Toronto and colleagues.The study involved 1,226 Canadian youth aged 16 to 25 (81.7% female) who had never smoked cigarettes but who reported using e-cigarettes. At the start of the study and every three months for a year, the participants were asked to answer questionnaires about how often they used e-cigarettes and their dependency on e-cigarettes (using the Penn State E-Cigarette Dependence Index). They were also asked about their use of other substances and symptoms of depression.The researchers found a strong association between the vaping dependence score at any given time point and depressive symptom score three months later—that is, someone with vaping dependence at three months was likely to have elevated depressive symptoms at six months. The analysis also found that higher vaping frequency was associated with future vaping dependence, but it did not find any association between vaping frequency and future depression.“These results are consistent with the diathesis-stress model of substance use and depression,” the researchers wrote. “People who are already vulnerable (i.e., a diathesis) to mental illness would have their psychological state triggered or made worse through smoking (a stressor).” The researchers suggested that the cycles of nicotine withdrawal and relief through vaping exacerbate depressive symptoms in people who are nicotine dependent.Chaiton M, Fan J, Bondy SJ, et al.

Videos Humanizing Mental Illness by Actors Found EffectiveOnTrackNYBrief educational videos aimed at reducing stigma toward people with psychosis appear equally effective regardless of whether the protagonist in the video is a person with lived experience or an actor, a report in Psychiatric Services has found.“A video posted online creates a digital footprint that can expose the presenter to undesired outcomes,” wrote the researchers at Columbia University and colleagues. “Providing people with lived experience the autonomy to choose between presenting their story directly or through a professional actor might empower those who feel uncomfortable with public self-disclosure.”This research team has conducted several studies evaluating people’s attitudes toward people with serious mental illness after watching one- to two-minute videos in which a speaker describes the experience of living with schizophrenia. For this newest analysis, the team developed a pair of two-minute videos, both featuring a Black man in his mid-20s. One video featured a man with lived experience describing what it’s like to live with schizophrenia. The other featured a professional actor describing living with schizophrenia (based on the help of a focus group and direct quotes from people with schizophrenia).The team then recruited 1,216 adults aged 18 to 30 to one of three groups: one group watched the lived experience video, one watched the actor video, and one group watched neither video. The participants filled out surveys prior to watching, after watching, and 30 days later. The surveys included questions on stigma and how emotionally engaging the videos were.Both videos significantly reduced viewers’ stigma toward people with schizophrenia immediately after watching (with an effect size up to 0.65) and 30 days later (with an effect size up to 0.57) relative to the control condition.Additional analysis comparing changes in stigma and engagement scores from baseline to postintervention and from baseline to the 30-day follow-up across stigma domains revealed that the actor video was not inferior to the lived experience video.Amsalem D, Jankowski SE, Pagdon S, et al.

Personality Traits May Offer Clues About Dementia RiskGetty Images/iStock/Olivier Le MoalIndividuals who have high neuroticism and/or low conscientiousness are at higher risk of being diagnosed with dementia, suggests a meta-analysis published in Alzheimer’s & Dementia.Researchers at the University of California, Davis, and colleagues examined data from eight longitudinal studies of cognition and dementia that included personality traits as possible dementia predictors. The sample included 44,531 people from four countries (United States, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands). They explored the impact of the “Big Five” personality traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism, and openness) as well as three measures of subjective well-being (positive affect, negative affect, and life satisfaction).The researchers found that higher neuroticism and negative affect were associated with increased dementia risk, whereas higher conscientiousness, extraversion, and positive affect were associated with reduced dementia risk. Neuroticism and conscientiousness appeared to have the strongest link with dementia across multiple models tested.In contrast, the researchers found no association between any personality measures and dementia-related pathology, such as atherosclerosis in the brain or amyloid protein accumulation.“Although the Big Five and aspects of [subjective well-being] were not associated with neuropathology at autopsy, moderator analyses reveal some evidence that these psychological factors may also act as predispositions that influence neuropathology,” the researchers wrote. “Future work is needed to build upon these key findings, focusing on more nuanced, time-varying questions to determine the temporal ordering of these associations and mechanisms underlying them.” ■Beck ED, Yoneda T, James BD, et al.

Early detection of AD can help with proper treatment and prevent brain tissue damage. Traditional medical tests are time consuming, fail to recognize early signs and lack of diagnosis sensitivity and specificity. To achieve promising prediction accuracy, the best predictive machine learning model is selected based on initial pre-processing step followed by vital attributes selection and performance evaluation for five proposed supervised machine learning algorithms. In the pre-processing, all the missing values have been removed since the overall percentage only covered 5.63%.

A direct relationship between hippocampal volume reductions in schizophrenia and memory impairment on the behavioral level has not consistently been shown. 7The goals of our study were to investigate possible sex differences in hippocampal volume and episodic memory performance in schizophrenia and to analyze the relationship between memory performance in schizophrenia and hippocampal volumes.METHODThe sample comprised 21 inpatients (14 males, 7 females) who met DSM-IV criteria for a lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia (SCID). Subjects with a history of head injury, neurological diseases, or substance dependence or abuse (SCID) were excluded. The mean duration of disorder was 8 (±9) years (females: 11±9; males: 7±9). Participants had experienced a mean of 3 (±2) previous hospitalizations (females: 3±2, males: 3±3). All subjects were on antipsychotic medication (mean chlorpromazine equivalent dose at testing was 501±416 mg/day; females: 419±356 mg/day, males: 542±450 mg/day). Male and female subjects with schizophrenia did not significantly differ on clinical variables (t tests, p>0.3 in all cases). Subjects with schizophrenia were compared with 21 healthy comparison subjects without a history of neurological or psychiatric disorder who were closely matched for age, sex, years of education (full-time school and vocational/university education combined), height and handedness, and were paid for their participation. Sociodemographic data are separately given for group and gender in Table 1 . Group by gender analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no differences between groups on these variables (p>0.5 in all cases). After complete description of the study informed written consent of all participants was obtained. The Ethical Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Marburg approved the study design. TABLE 1. Sociodemographic Data, Brain Volumes, and Memory Performance of Subjects with Schizophrenia and Comparison SubjectsTABLE 1. Sociodemographic Data, Brain Volumes, and Memory Performance of Subjects with Schizophrenia and Comparison SubjectsEnlarge table All subjects received a magnetic resonance (MR) scan using a 1.5-Tesla clinical MRI scanner (Signa Horizon, General Electric Medical Systems) machine on the day of the assessment. Scanning parameters of the T 1 -weighted three-dimensional sequence (fast spoiled gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state; FSPGR) were as follows: TE=4.2 msec, TR=9 msec; flip angle=20 o ; number of excitations=3, FOV=25×19; slice plane=axial; matrix=256×256; slice thickness=1.4 mm (no gap); slice number=120. Volumetric analysis was done on the basis of the individual 3D-MR images using the CURRY ® software (version 4.5; Neurosoft, Inc., El Paso, Tex.). Images were reformatted into continuous slices of 1 mm thickness. Total brain volume was calculated with automated multistep algorithms and 3D region growing methods that are limited by gray value thresholds. Simultaneous 3D visualization of brain structures and manual tracing allowed a precise identification and delineation of regions of interest. The hippocampus was disarticulated from surrounding tissue on coronal slices by means of manual tracing according to a standardized protocol 8 and the serial sections provided by Duvernoy. 9 The protocol had been developed to reduce discrepancies in hippocampal measurements between researchers. A single trained rater (BN), who was blind to the subjects' test performance and clinical diagnoses, completed the analyses. The intrarater reliability based on 12 randomly chosen cases was r=0.91 (intraclass correlation coefficient). Clinical and cognitive assessment and MR imaging of schizophrenia subjects were performed in a clinically stable phase within 3 weeks after admission. Symptom severity was assessed at the time of testing by using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and resulted in a mean 80 (±26) total PANSS score. There was no significant difference between PANSS scores of female (87±34) and male (76±21) subjects (p>0.3). As episodic long-term memory is the cognitive function most severely disturbed in schizophrenia, and the one most closely related to hippocampal abnormalities, 2 , 3 episodic verbal and visual memory was chosen as the main cognitive outcome variable. It was assessed with the subtests Logical Memory I and II and Visual Reproduction I and II, respectively, from the German version of the Wechsler Memory Scale—Revised (WMS-R). Principal statistical methods used were analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and Pearson's correlations. Statistical comparisons were performed using the SPSS (SPSS for Windows, Version 12.0).RESULTS Two separate Group x Sex ANCOVAs comparing left and right hippocampal volume while adjusting for total brain volume revealed significant Group x Sex interactions for both hemispheres ( Table 1 ). Compared with male comparison subjects, male schizophrenia subjects had significantly smaller left (−21%) and right (−22%) hippocampal volumes. Hippocampal volume of female schizophrenia subjects did not differ from comparison subjects ( Figure 1 ). FIGURE 1. Mean Left and Right Hippocampal Volumes of Male versus Female Subjects with Schizophrenia and Comparison Subjects Four separate 2 (Group) x 2 (Sex) ANOVAs comparing episodic memory performance revealed significant effects of Group (schizophrenia subjects showing lower performance on all four subtests) but no significant effect of Sex and no significant Group x Sex interaction ( Table 1 ). Larger right hippocampal volume of subjects with schizophrenia was significantly related to visual memory performance (WMS-R, Visual Reproduction I, r=0.502, p=0.029). However, this significant positive relationship for the whole group could be attributed to the association between hippocampal volume and visual memory in male schizophrenia subjects (r=0.54, p=0.055) rather than female subjects (r=0.228, p=0.664) ( Figure 2 ). FIGURE 2. Scattergram Showing the Relationship between Right Hippocampal Volume (X-axis) and Visual Episodic Memory Performance (WMS-R, Visual Reproduction, Immediate Recall) (Y-axis) in Schizophrenia Subjects by GenderNo other significant relationship emerged between hippocampal volumes and memory performance (p>0.2 in all cases). In subjects with schizophrenia psychopathological measures (PANSS total score and subscores) were not related to hippocampal volume (p>0.2 in all cases) or cognitive measures (p>0.6 in all cases). Antipsychotic dosage was neither related to cognitive nor morphometric variables (p>0.2 in all cases). An additional anticholinergic medication in four schizophrenia subjects did not compromise memory performance (U tests, p>0.2 in all cases).DISCUSSION We found bilateral hippocampal volume reductions in male schizophrenia subjects while hippocampal volumes of female schizophrenia subjects did not differ from female comparison subjects. These sex differences were not due to insufficient statistical power for the female subgroup: means of female schizophrenia subjects and female comparison subjects were virtually identical ( Table 1 ) and sample size—though low—was sufficient to detect differences of the magnitude found for male subjects (effect size d=1.38). Sex differences on hippocampal volumes were also not attributable to differing sociodemographic or clinical sample characteristics of male and female schizophrenia subjects. Nevertheless, small samples always carry the risk of sampling biases. Volume reductions of the hippocampal formation in first-episode and chronic schizophrenia are a consistent finding in MRI research 1 , 10 but analyses have been mainly conducted with male subjects. Analyses of sexual dimorphism in schizophrenia hippocampal pathology have yielded inconsistent results with some studies reporting that male schizophrenia subjects are more affected, 4 and some finding no differences. 5 , 6 More pronounced brain abnormalities in male schizophrenia subjects have, however, repeatedly been found for other brain structures, namely the lateral ventricles and the whole temporal lobe. 11 Sex differences in brain pathology of schizophrenia subjects have been attributed to an interaction between pathophysiological mechanisms and normal sexual dimorphism in brain development. Within the framework of neurodevelopmental hypotheses of schizophrenia it has been proposed that hippocampal volume reductions in schizophrenia reflect early impact on the developing brain rather than a genetic predisposition. 12 Male brains might be more vulnerable to brain insults because of delayed lateralization and lack of protection from estrogen. 13 We could further show that reduced right hippocampal volumes in male schizophrenia subjects were specifically related to deficits of visual episodic memory. Reduced hippocampal volume might represent an anatomical substrate of deficient memory function in males with schizophrenia. A positive relationship between hippocampal volume and memory performance has been shown for other memory-impaired patient groups (e.g., premature born children) 14 but might be restricted to subjects with pathologically affected hippocampi. The fact that episodic memory deficits were also present in female schizophrenia subjects despite normal hippocampal volumes suggests that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to memory deficits differ between the two sexes. Small sample sizes in our study and acute illness state of schizophrenia subjects prevent firm conclusions from our results. However, our findings might stimulate further research relating to gender differences on morphometric and cognitive variables in schizophrenia. More research in larger and clinically stable outpatient populations is needed to confirm our findings.Received October 26, 2006; revised March 16 and April 16, 2007; accepted April 16, 2007. Drs.

Lee; Leung‐wing Chu; Howard Rosen; Bruce Miller; Henry Ka Fung Mak,"International multi-centre neuroimaging initiatives such as ADNI and AIBL are excellent, convenient resources for researchers; however, for these global cohorts, ethnicity may be a confounding factor. Morphometric differences have been found between European and Japanese brains, and a recent study has demonstrated that young American Caucasians have thicker frontal and parietal association cortices than their Singaporean Chinese counterparts, although the difference could not be attributed definitively to either ethnicity or environment/culture. To understand the effect of ethnicity in normal ageing, and its possible implications in the diagnosis and progression of neurodegenerative disease, further research is required. We identified 32 cognitively normal Hong Kong Chinese elderly individuals (HK-Ch) who had received high resolution T1-weighted imaging on a 3T MRI scanner using a protocol consistent with the ADNI guidelines and compared cortical volumes with those from 99 Caucasians from the ADNI database (ADNI-C) chosen to match the HK cohort in age and gender distribution. To replicate our analysis, we performed the same comparison in 32 Chinese cognitively normal elders (UCSF-Ch) and 32 matched cognitively normal Caucasians (UCSF-C) scanned using the same protocol at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). All scans were processed at UCSF using FreeSurfer v5.1. Segmented and parcellated volumes were extracted and analysed in Stata 11. We compared total cortical volume (TCV) and the combined cortical volume of regions typically affected by Alzheimer's disease (ADRCV), correcting for brain volume. Our findings show that ethnicity has an effect on TCV, and may also affect AD-specific regions. Future studies should take care to use ethnically appropriate comparison groups. Further research can be conducted longitudinally on larger cohorts, with identical clinical assessment and follow-up. If such studies confirm our findings, further exploration into the biological basis of ethnically-driven cortical volume differences could be conducted.",10,4S_Part_7,,,Neuroimaging; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; Confounding; Ethnic group; Medicine; Cohort; Psychology; Disease; Brain size; Gerontology; Internal medicine; Cognitive impairment; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neuroscience; Radiology; Sociology; Anthropology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2014.05.217,,10.1016/j.jalz.2014.05.217,,,0,,0,false,,

Given previous literature suggesting prominence of thalamic structural changes in DLB, we also specifically analysed changes in the thalamus by segmenting the thalamus into 25 nuclei, which were then grouped into six regions (anterior, lateral, ventral, intralaminar, medial and posterior) (Watson et al. 2017, Iglesias et al. 2018).

MethodsHundred-eighty community-recruited cognitively intact older adults (mean age 68 years, range 52-80 years, 81 women) belonging to the Flemish Prevent Alzheimer's Disease KU Leuven (F-PACK) longitudinal observational cohort underwent a baseline evaluation consisting of detailed cognitive assessment, structural MRI and 18F-flutemetamol PET. At inclusion, subjects were stratified based on Apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) val66met polymorphism according to a factorial design. At inclusion, 15% were amyloid PET positive (Centiloid &gt; 23.4). All subjects underwent 2-yearly follow-up of cognitive performance for a 4-year time period. Baseline cognitive scores were analysed using factor analysis. The slope of cognitive change over time was modelled using latent growth curve analysis. Using correlation analysis, hierarchical regression and mediation analysis, we examined the effect of demographic (age, sex, education) and genetic variables, baseline cognition, MRI volumetric (both voxelwise and region-based) as well as amyloid imaging measures on the longitudinal slope of cognitive change. ResultsA base model of age and sex explained 18% of variance in episodic memory decline. This increased to 41.6\% by adding baseline episodic memory scores. Adding amyloid load or volumetric measures explained only a negligible additional amount of variance (increase to 42.2%). A mediation analysis indicated that the effect of age on episodic memory scores was partly direct and partly mediated via hippocampal volume. Amyloid load did not play a significant role as mediator between age, hippocampal volume and episodic memory decline. ConclusionIn cognitively intact older adults, the strongest baseline predictor of subsequent episodic memory decline was the baseline episodic memory score. When this score was included, only very limited explanatory power was added by brain volume or amyloid load measures. The data warn against classifications that are purely biomarker-based and highlight the value of baseline cognitive performance levels in predictive models.</jats:p>",,,,,Cognitive decline; Episodic memory; Cognition; Psychology; Longitudinal study; Mediation; Effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance; Apolipoprotein E; Internal medicine; Gerontology; Clinical psychology; Medicine; Developmental psychology; Dementia; Disease; Neuroscience; Pathology; Political science; Law,,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-125104/v1.pdf?c=1607733123000 https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-125104/v1 https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13195-021-00798-4 https://doi.org/10.1186/s13195-021-00798-4 https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/674217/2/Baseline%20cognition%20is%20the%20best%20predictor%20of%204-year%20cognitive%20change%20in%20cognitively%20intact%20older%20adults.pdf https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/674217 https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/20.500.12942/696392/2/v1_covered.pdf https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/20.500.12942/696392,http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-125104/v1,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-125104/v1,,,0,,1,true,cc-by,green

Surendran,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>;         <jats:p>In recent studies, several machine learning and deep learning prediction models have been proposed for the early detection and classification of various stages of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Many years before the actual onset of AD, there occur several structural changes in the brain. These structural brain features can be utilized in learning the disease progression from early stage of disease. The various stages of pathology cause mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from their normal cognition and AD from normal cognition. This chapter intends to develop a random forest learning model that utilizes a relevant subset of predictors to diagnose the progression of the disease. The conversion from normal cognition to MCI is identified at an early stage of the onset of structural brain changes. The importance of existing research works lies in more early identification of significant feature that increases the disease progression and appropriate inventions greatly improves subjects' recovery. The ADNI cross-sectional MRI data were analysed in this study that utilized brain curvature, grey matter white matter density, volume of cortical and sub cortical structures, shape of hippocampus, hippocampal subfield volume, Mini-mental state exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Estimated Total Intracranial Volume, Normalize Whole Brain Volume, and Atlas Scaling Factor for constructing randomized trees and thus predicting the features that cause the progression of disease stages from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease that causes dementia. This implementation model proved to give robust AD conversion probability and identifying significant features that are sufficient for future clinical inferences.</jats:p>",,,,,Dementia; Cognition; White matter; Random forest; Clinical Dementia Rating; Disease; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; Grey matter; Neuroimaging; Brain size; Psychology; Neuroscience; Medicine; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Internal medicine; Magnetic resonance imaging; Radiology,,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2140399/latest.pdf https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2140399/v1,http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2140399/v1,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-2140399/v1,,,0,015-240-327-019-342; 024-068-665-362-981; 040-979-639-940-925; 052-860-496-540-146; 071-907-904-045-369; 074-496-871-320-699; 093-265-878-050-549; 096-256-527-944-350; 114-137-792-250-797; 124-769-622-312-148; 138-608-986-824-305; 146-107-534-863-324,0,true,cc-by,green

Overlapping tremor features can be challenging to diagnosis and misdiagnosis is common. Although underlying neurodegenerative mechanisms are suggested, neuroimaging studies arrived at controversial results and often the different tremor types were not considered. We investigated whether different tremor types displayed distinct structural brain features. Structural MRI of 61 patients with essential tremor and 29 with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease was analysed using a fully automated artificial-intelligence-based brain volumetry to compare volumes of several cortical and subcortical regions. Furthermore, essential tremor subgroups with and without rest tremor or more pronounced postural and kinetic tremor were investigated. Deviations from an internal reference collective of age- and sex-adjusted healthy controls and volumetric differences between groups were examined; regression analysis was used to determine the contribution of disease-related factors on volumetric measurements. Compared with healthy controls, essential tremor and tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease patients displayed deviations in the occipital lobes, hippocampus, putamen, pallidum and mesencephalon while essential tremor patients exhibited decreased volumes within the nucleus caudatus and thalamus. Analysis of covariance revealed similar volumetric patterns in both diseases. Essential tremor patients without rest tremor showed a significant atrophy within the thalamus compared to tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease and atrophy of the mesencephalon and putamen were found in both subgroups compared to essential tremor with rest tremor. Disease-related factors contribute to volumes of occipital lobes in both diseases and to volumes of temporal lobes in essential tremor and the putamen in Parkinson's disease. Fully automated artificial-intelligence-based volumetry provides a fast and rater-independent method to investigate brain volumes in different neurological disorders and allows comparisons with an internal reference collective. Our results indicate that essential tremor and tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease share structural changes, indicative of neurodegenerative mechanisms, particularly of the basal-ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry. A discriminating, possibly disease-specific involvement of the thalamus was found in essential tremor patients without rest tremor and the mesencephalon and putamen in tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease and essential tremor without rest tremor.",5,6,fcad271,,Essential tremor; Putamen; Thalamus; Atrophy; Postural tremor; Parkinson's disease; Neuroscience; Medicine; Psychology; Neurology; Disease; Pathology,Parkinson’s disease; artificial intelligence; brain volumetry; tremor,,,,https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/braincomms/fcad271/52108944/fcad271.pdf https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcad271,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcad271,37946794,10.1093/braincomms/fcad271,,PMC10631860,0,001-086-735-043-56X; 001-970-630-278-941; 005-147-402-165-130; 006-619-588-236-310; 006-624-652-504-540; 009-305-653-811-834; 009-392-373-752-073; 013-231-599-022-716; 020-846-248-424-62X; 023-761-385-992-400; 025-793-752-124-824; 027-213-255-773-582; 030-152-345-906-184; 030-321-788-546-987; 032-698-970-919-172; 034-977-977-700-709; 035-429-858-921-372; 038-433-601-943-796; 043-969-650-911-519; 044-645-837-983-411; 045-705-604-018-627; 049-378-800-100-855; 052-078-353-843-190; 066-903-414-689-971; 071-173-433-060-887; 077-874-941-272-173; 079-270-616-106-273; 079-790-573-964-428; 084-272-563-631-364; 087-479-816-056-351; 087-556-003-796-543; 101-158-365-019-559; 103-786-704-650-709; 152-357-061-233-937,4,true,cc-by,gold

Models are validated against a manually quality checked subset (N=24,354) and we provide an interface for transferring to new data sources. We showcase the clinical value by applying the models to a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample (N=1985), showing they can be used to quantify variability underlying multiple disorders whilst also refining case-control inferences. These models will be augmented with additional samples and imaging modalities as they become available. This provides a common reference platform to bind results from different studies and ultimately paves the way for personalized clinical decision-making. Editor's evaluation This manuscript is of broad interest to the neuroimaging community. It establishes a detailed reference model of human brain development and lifespan trajectories based on a very large data set, across many cortical and subcortical brain regions. The model not only explains substantial variability on test data, it also successfully uncovers individual differences on a database of psychiatric patients that, in addition to group-level analyses, may be critical for diagnosis, thereby demonstrating high clinical potential. It presents a clear overview of the data resource, including detailed evaluation metrics, and makes code, models and documentation directly available to the community. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72904.sa0 Decision letter Reviews on Sciety eLife's review process Introduction Since their introduction more than a century ago, normative growth charts have become fundamental tools in pediatric medicine and also in many other areas of anthropometry (Cole, 2012). They provide the ability to quantify individual variation against centiles of variation in a reference population, which shifts focus away from group-level (e.g., case-control) inferences to the level of the individual. This idea has been adopted and generalized in clinical neuroimaging, and normative modeling is now established as an effective technique for providing inferences at the level of the individual in neuroimaging studies (Marquand et al., 2016; Marquand et al., 2019). Although normative modeling can be used to estimate many different kinds of mappings—for example between behavioral scores and neurobiological readouts—normative models of brain development and aging are appealing considering that many brain disorders are grounded in atypical trajectories of brain development (Insel, 2014) and the association between cognitive decline and brain tissue in aging and neurodegenerative diseases (Jack et al., 2010; Karas et al., 2004). Indeed, normative modeling has been applied in many different clinical contexts, including charting the development of infants born pre-term (Dimitrova et al., 2020) and dissecting the biological heterogeneity across cohorts of individuals with different brain disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Bethlehem et al., 2020; Wolfers et al., 2021; Zabihi et al., 2019). A hurdle to the widespread application of normative modeling is a lack of well-defined reference models to quantify variability across the lifespan and to compare results from different studies. Such models should: (1) accurately model population variation across large samples; (2) be derived from widely accessible measures; (3) provide the ability to be updated as additional data come online, (4) be supported by easy-to-use software tools, and (5) should quantify brain development and aging at a high spatial resolution, so that different patterns of atypicality can be used to stratify cohorts and predict clinical outcomes with maximum spatial precision. Prior work on building normative modeling reference cohorts (Bethlehem et al., 2021) has achieved some of these aims (1–4), but has modeled only global features (i.e., total brain volume), which is useful for quantifying brain growth but has limited utility for the purpose of stratifying clinical cohorts (aim 5). The purpose of this paper is to introduce a set of reference models that satisfy all these criteria. To this end, we assemble a large neuroimaging data set (Table 1) from 58,836 individuals across 82 scan sites covering the human lifespan (aged 2–100, Figure 1A) and fit normative models for cortical thickness and subcortical volumes derived from Freesurfer (version 6.0). We show the clinical utility of these models in a large transdiagnostic psychiatric sample (N=1985, Figure 2). To maximize the utility of this contribution, we distribute model coefficients freely along with a set of software tools to enable researchers to derive subject-level predictions for new data sets against a set of common reference models.

These sex differences manifest as a shift in the mean in that the shape of these trajectories is the same for both sexes, as determined by sensitivity analyses where separate normative models were estimated for each sex.

Results We split the available data into training and test sets, stratifying by site (Table 1, Supplementary files 1 and 2). After careful quality checking procedures, we fit normative models using a set of covariates (age, sex, and fixed effects for site) to predict cortical thickness and subcortical volume for each parcel in a high-resolution atlas (Destrieux et al., 2010). We employed a warped Bayesian linear regression model to accurately model non-linear and non-Gaussian effects (Fraza et al., 2021), whilst accounting for scanner effects (Bayer et al., 2021; Kia et al., 2021). These models are summarized in Figure 1 and Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplements 1–3, and with an online interactive visualization tool for exploring the evaluation metrics across different test sets (overview of this tool shown in Video 1). The raw data used in these visualizations are available on GitHub (Rutherford, 2022a). Figure 3 with 3 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Evaluation metrics across all test sets. The distribution of evaluation metrics in four different test sets (full, mQC, patients, and transfer, see Materials and methods) separated into left and right hemispheres and subcortical regions, with the skew and excess kurtosis being measures that depict the accuracy of the estimated shape of the model, ideally both would be around zero. Note that kurtosis is highly sensitive to outlying samples. Overall, these models show that the models fit well in term of central tendency and variance (explained variance and MSLL) and model the shape of the distribution well in most regions (skew and kurtosis). Code and sample data for transferring these models to new sites not included in training is shared.

We validate our models with several careful procedures: first, we report out of sample metrics; second, we perform a supplementary analysis on a subset of participants for whom input data had undergone manual quality checking by an expert rater (Table 1 – mQC). Third, each model fit was evaluated using metrics (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplements 1–3) that quantify central tendency and distributional accuracy (Dinga et al., 2021; Fraza et al., 2021). We also estimated separate models for males and females, which indicate that sex effects are adequately modeled using a global offset. Finally, to facilitate independent validation, we packaged pretrained models and code for transferring to new samples into an open resource for use by the community and demonstrated how to transfer the models to new samples (i.e., data not present in the initial training set). Our models provide the opportunity for mapping the diverse trajectories of different brain areas. Several examples are shown in Figure 1C and D which align with known patterns of development and aging (Ducharme et al., 2016; Gogtay et al., 2004; Tamnes et al., 2010). Moreover, across the cortex and subcortex our model fits well, explaining up to 80% of the variance out of sample (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplements 1–3). A goal of this work is to develop normative models that can be applied to many different clinical conditions. To showcase this, we apply the model to a transdiagnostic psychiatric cohort (Table 1 – Clinical; Figure 2) resulting in personalized, whole-brain deviation maps that can be used to understand inter-individual variability (e.g., for stratification) and to quantify group separation (e.g., case-control effects). To demonstrate this, for each clinical group, we summarized the individual deviations within that group by computing the proportion of subjects that have deviations in each region and comparing to matched (same sites) controls in the test set (Figure 2B–C). Additionally, we performed case-control comparisons on the raw cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, and on the deviation maps (Figure 2D), again against a matched sample from the test set. This demonstrates the advantages of using normative models for investigating individual differences in psychiatry, that is, quantifying clinically relevant information at the level of each individual. For most diagnostic groups, the z-statistics derived from the normative deviations also provided stronger case-control effects than the raw data. This shows the importance of accurate modeling of population variance across multiple clinically relevant dimensions. The individual-level deviations provide complimentary information to the group effects, which aligns with previous work (Wolfers et al., 2018; Wolfers et al., 2020; Zabihi et al., 2020). We note that a detailed description of the clinical significance of our findings is beyond the scope of this work and will be presented separately. Discussion In this work, we create lifespan brain charts of cortical thickness and subcortical volume derived from structural MRI, to serve as reference models. Multiple data sets were joined to build a mega-site lifespan reference cohort to provide good coverage of the lifespan. We applied the reference cohort models to clinical data sets and demonstrated the benefits of normative modeling in addition to standard case-control comparisons. All models, including documentation and code, are made available to the research community. We also provide an example data set (that includes data from sites not in the training sample) along with the code to demonstrate how well our models can adapt to new sites, and how easy it is to transfer our pretrained models to users’ own data sets. We identify three main strengths of our approach. First, our large lifespan data set provides high anatomical specificity, necessary for discriminating between conditions, predicting outcomes, and stratifying subtypes. Second, our models are flexible in that they can model non-Gaussian distributions, can easily be transferred to new sites, and are built on validated analytical techniques and software tools (Fraza et al., 2021; Kia et al., 2021; Marquand et al., 2019). Third, we show the general utility of this work in that it provides the ability to map individual variation whilst also improving case-control inferences across multiple disorders. In recent work, a large consortium established lifespan brain charts that are complementary to our approach (Bethlehem et al., 2021). Benefits of their work include precisely quantifying brain growth using a large cohort, but they only provide estimates of four coarse global measures (e.g., total brain volume). While this can precisely quantify brain growth and aging this does not provide the ability to generate individualized fingerprints or to stratify clinical cohorts. In contrast, in this work, we focus on providing spatially specific estimates (188 different brain regions) across the post-natal lifespan which provides fine-grained anatomical estimates of deviation, offering an individualized perspective that can be used for clinical stratification. We demonstrate the transdiagnostic clinical value of our models (Figure 2) by showing how clinical variation is widespread in a fine-grain manner (e.g., not all individuals deviate in the same regions and not all disorders have the same characteristic patterns) and we facilitate clinical applications of our models by sharing tutorial code notebooks with sample data that can be run locally or online in a web browser. We also identify the limitations of this work. We view the word ‘normative’ as problematic. This language implies that there are normal and abnormal brains, a potentially problematic assumption. As indicated in Figure 2, there is considerable individual variability and heterogeneity among trajectories. We encourage the use of the phrase ‘reference cohort’ over ‘normative model’. In order to provide coverage of the lifespan the curated data set is based on aggregating existing data, meaning there is unavoidable sampling bias. Race, education, and socioeconomic variables were not fully available for all included data sets, however, given that data were compiled from research studies, they are likely samples drawn predominantly from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies (Henrich et al., 2010) and future work should account for these factors. The sampling bias of UKBiobank (Fry et al., 2017) is especially important for users to consider as UKBiobank data contributes 59% of the full sample. By sampling both healthy population samples and case-control studies, we achieve a reasonable estimate of variation across individuals, however, downstream analyses should consider the nature of the reference cohort and whether it is appropriate for the target sample. Second, we have relied on semi-automated quality control (QC) for the full sample which—despite a conservative choice of inclusion threshold—does not guarantee either that low-quality data were excluded or that the data were excluded are definitively excluded because of artifacts. We addressed this by comparing our full test set to a manually quality check data set and observed similar model performance. Also, Freesurfer was not adjusted for the very young age ranges (2–7 yo) thus caution should be used when interpreting the model on new data in this age range. Finally, although the models presented in this study are comprehensive, they are only the first step, and we will augment our repository with more diverse data, different features, and modeling advances as these become available. Materials and methods Data from 82 sites were combined to create the initial full sample. These sites are described in detail in Supplementary files 1-2, including the sample size, age (mean and standard deviation), and sex distribution of each site. Many sites were pulled from publicly available data sets including ABCD, ABIDE, ADHD200, CAMCAN, CMI-HBN, HCP-Aging, HCP-Development, HCP-Early Psychosis, HCP-Young Adult, IXI, NKI-RS, Oasis, OpenNeuro, PNC, SRPBS, and UKBiobank. For data sets that include repeated visits (i.e., ABCD and UKBiobank), only the first visit was included. Other included data come from studies conducted at the University of Michigan (Duval et al., 2018; Rutherford et al., 2020; Tomlinson et al., 2020; Tso et al., 2021; Weigard et al., 2021; Zucker et al., 2009), University of California Davis (Nordahl et al., 2020), University of Oslo (Nesvåg et al., 2017), King’s College London (Green et al., 2012; Lythe et al., 2015), and Amsterdam University Medical Center (Mocking et al., 2016). Full details regarding sample characteristics, diagnostic procedures, and acquisition protocols can be found in the publications associated with each of the studies. Equal sized training and testing data sets (split half) were created using scikit-learn’s train_test_split function, stratifying on the site variable. It is important to stratify based on site, not only study (Bethlehem et al., 2021), as many of the public studies (i.e., ABCD) include several sites, thus modeling study does not adequately address MRI scanner confounds. To test stability of the model performance, the full test set was randomly resampled 10 times and evaluation metrics were re-calculated on each split of the full test set (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). To show generalizability of the models to new data not included in training, we leveraged data from OpenNeuro.org (Markiewicz et al., 2021) to create a transfer data set (six sites, N=546, Supplementary file 3). This data are provided along with the code for transferring to walk users through how to apply these models to their own data. The clinical validation sample consisted of a subset of the full data set (described in detail in Figure 1A, Figure 2A and Supplementary file 1). Studies (sites) contributing clinical data included: Autism Brain Imaging Database Exchange (ABIDE GU, KKI, NYU, USM), ADHD200 (KKI, NYU), CNP, SRPBS (CIN, COI, KTT, KUT, HKH, HRC, HUH, SWA, UTO), Delta (AmsterdamUMC), Human Connectome Project Early Psychosis (HCP-EP BWH, IU, McL, MGH), KCL, University of Michigan Children Who Stutter (UMich_CWS), University of Michigan Social Anxiety Disorder (UMich_SAD), University of Michigan Schizophrenia Gaze Processing (UMich_SZG), and TOP (University of Oslo). In addition to the sample-specific inclusion criteria, inclusion criteria for the full sample were based on participants having basic demographic information (age and sex), a T1-weighted MRI volume, and Freesurfer output directories that include summary files that represent left and right hemisphere cortical thickness values of the Destrieux parcellation and subcortical volumetric values (aseg.stats, lh.aparc.a2009s.stats, and rh.aparc.a2009s.stats). Freesurfer image analysis suite (version 6.0) was used for cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation for all studies. The technical details of these procedures are described in prior publications (Dale et al., 1999; Fischl et al., 2002; Fischl and Dale, 2000). UK Biobank was the only study for which Freesurfer was not run by the authors. Freesurfer functions aparcstats2table and asegstats2table were run to extract cortical thickness from the Destrieux parcellation (Destrieux et al., 2010) and subcortical volume for all participants into CSV files. These files were inner merged with the demographic files, using Pandas, and NaN rows were dropped. QC is an important consideration for large samples and is an active research area (Alfaro-Almagro et al., 2018; Klapwijk et al., 2019; Rosen et al., 2018). We consider manual quality checking of images both prior to and after preprocessing to be the gold standard. However, this is labor intensive and prohibitive for very large samples. Therefore, in this work, we adopt a pragmatic and multi-pronged approach to QC. First, a subset of the full data set underwent manual quality checking (mQC) by author S.R. Papaya, a JavaScript-based image viewer. Manual quality checking was performed during December 2020 when the Netherlands was in full lockdown due to COVID-19 and S.R. was living alone in a new country with a lot of free time. Data included in this manual QC step was based on what was available at the time (Supplementary file 2). Later data sets that were included were not manually QC’d due to resource and time constraints. Scripts were used to initialize a manual QC session and track progress and organize ratings. All images (T1w volume and Freesurfer brain.finalsurfs) were put into JSON files that the mQC script would call when loading Papaya. Images were rated using a ‘pass/fail/flag’ scale and the rating was tracked in an automated manner using keyboard inputs (up arrow=pass, down arrow=fail, F key=flag, and left/right arrows were used to move through subjects). Each subject’s T1w volume was viewed in 3D volumetric space, with the Freesurfer brain.finalsurfs file as an overlay, to check for obvious quality issues such as excessive motion, ghosting or ringing artifacts. Example scripts used for quality checking and further instructions for using the manual QC environment can be found on GitHub(Rutherford, 2022c copy archived at swh:1:rev:70894691c74febe2a4d40ab0c84c50094b9e99ce). We relied on ABCD consortium QC procedures for the QC for this sample. The ABCD study data distributes a variable (freesqc01.txt; fsqc_qc = = 1/0) that represents manual quality checking (pass/fail) of the T1w volume and Freesurfer data, thus this data set was added into our manual quality checked data set bringing the sample size to 24,354 individuals passing manual quality checks. Note that QC was performed on the data prior to splitting of the data to assess generalizability. Although this has a reduced sample, we consider this to be a gold-standard sample in that every single scan has been checked manually. All inferences reported in this manuscript were validated against this sample. Second, for the full sample, we adopted an automated QC procedure that quantifies image quality based on the Freesurfer Euler Characteristic (EC), which has been shown to be an excellent proxy for manual labeling of scan quality (Monereo-Sánchez et al., 2021; Rosen et al., 2018) and is the most important feature in automated scan quality classifiers (Klapwijk et al., 2019). Since the distribution of the EC varies across sites, we adopt a simple approach that involves scaling and centering the distribution over the EC across sites and removing samples in the tail of the distribution (see Kia et al., 2021 for details). While any automated QC heuristic is by definition imperfect, we note that this is based on a conservative inclusion threshold such that only samples well into the tail of the EC distribution are excluded, which are likely to be caused by true topological defects rather than abnormalities due to any underlying pathology. We separated the evaluation metrics into full test set (relying on automated QC) and mQC test set in order to compare model performance between the two QC approaches and were pleased to notice that the evaluation metrics were nearly identical across the two methods. Normative modeling was run using python 3.8 and the PCNtoolkit package (version 0.20). Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) with likelihood warping was used to predict cortical thickness and subcortical volume from a vector of covariates (age, sex, and site). For a complete mathematical description and explanation of this implementation, see Fraza et al., 2021. Briefly, for each brain region of interest (cortical thickness or subcortical volume), y is predicted as: (1) y=wTϕx+ϵ where wT is the estimated weight vector, ϕx is a basis expansion of the of covariate vector x, consisting of a B-spline basis expansion (cubic spline with five evenly spaced knots) to model non-linear effects of age, and ϵ=η0,β a Gaussian noise distribution with mean zero and noise precision term β (the inverse variance). A likelihood warping approach (Rios and Tobar, 2019; Snelson et al., 2003) was used to model non-Gaussian effects. This involves applying a bijective non-linear warping function to the non-Gaussian response variables to map them to a Gaussian latent space where inference can be performed in closed form. We employed a ‘sinarcsinsh’ warping function, which is equivalent to the SHASH distribution commonly used in the generalized additive modeling literature (Jones and Pewsey, 2009) and which we have found to perform well in prior work (Dinga et al., 2021; Fraza et al., 2021). Site variation was modeled using fixed effects, which we have shown in prior work provides relatively good performance (Kia et al., 2021), although random effects for site may provide additional flexibility at higher computational cost. A fast numerical optimization algorithm was used to optimize hyperparameters (L-BFGS). Computational complexity of hyperparameter optimization was controlled by minimizing the negative log-likelihood. Deviation scores (Z-scores) are calculated for the n-th subject, and d-th brain area, in the test set as: (2) Znd=ynd−y^ndσd2+(σ∗2)d Where ynd is the true response, y^nd is the predicted mean, σd2 is the estimated noise variance (reflecting uncertainty in the data), and σ2d is the variance attributed to modeling uncertainty. Model fit for each brain region was evaluated by calculating the explained variance (which measures central tendency), the mean squared log-loss (MSLL, central tendency, and variance) plus skew and kurtosis of the deviation scores (2) which measures how well the shape of the regression function matches the data (Dinga et al., 2021). Note that for all models, we report out of sample metrics. To provide a summary of individual variation within each clinical group, deviation scores were summarized for each clinical group (Figure 2B–C) by first separating them into positive and negative deviations, counting how many subjects had an extreme deviation (positive extreme deviation defined as Z>2, negative extreme deviation as Z<−2) at a given ROI, and then dividing by the group size to show the percentage of individuals with extreme deviations at that brain area. Controls from the same sites as the patient groups were summarized in the same manner for comparison. We also performed classical case versus control group difference testing on the true data and on the deviation scores (Figure 2D) and thresholded results at a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate of p<0.05. Note that in both cases, we directly contrast each patient group to their matched controls to avoid nuisance variation confounding any reported effects (e.g., sampling characteristics and demographic differences). All pretrained models and code are shared online with straightforward directions for transferring to new sites and including an example transfer data set derived from several OpenNeuro.org data sets. Given a new set of data (e.g., sites not present in the training set), this is done by first applying the warp parameters estimating on the training data to the new data set, adjusting the mean and variance in the latent Gaussian space, then (if necessary) warping the adjusted data back to the original space, which is similar",,,,,Neuroimaging; Normative; Modalities; Computer science; Set (abstract data type); Population; Data science; Data set; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Machine learning; Cognitive psychology; Medicine; Neuroscience; Social science; Philosophy; Environmental health; Epistemology; Sociology; Programming language,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.72904.sa1,,10.7554/elife.72904.sa1,,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

In response to this challenge, most countries have committed to conducting more research to overcome these challenges, including improving timely diagnosis. The final outcome of this system can determine the clinical stage of individuals with different levels of dementia, such as non-demented, moderately demented, mild demented, and very mild demented, by analyzing brain MRI scans of dementia patients. It also aims to determine the clinical dementia rating based on background data such as age, years of education, socioeconomic status, MMSE score, estimated total intracranial volume, normalized whole brain volume, and atlas scaling factor. Additionally, the system can identify brain tumors when MRI scans are included. Apart from the dementia field, the system is capable of detecting pneumonia using chest X-rays, although it is generally a rare condition. Unfortunately, aspiration pneumonia is more common in people with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. The ultimate goal of this research project is to develop a web-based system that enables healthcare professionals to determine the clinical stage of dementia patients while also facilitating the detection of brain tumors and pneumonia utilizing computer science and technology.",,,412,417,Dementia; Medicine; Clinical Dementia Rating; Socioeconomic status; Disease; Population; Stage (stratigraphy); Internal medicine; Paleontology; Environmental health; Biology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iciis58898.2023.10253503,,10.1109/iciis58898.2023.10253503,,,0,013-874-665-128-711; 023-795-290-727-941; 044-433-607-807-952; 053-406-041-385-641; 064-189-590-701-302; 075-757-654-366-075; 077-671-574-254-618; 091-962-622-460-107; 164-686-464-750-552,0,false,,

Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), MMSE, Logical Memory Subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese Revision, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease drawing and WCST were administered to assess cognitive function and psychological and behavioral symptoms. Then voxel-based morphometry and diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra (VBM-DARTEL) was used to compare the structural difference between bvFTD and control groups. Partial correlation analysis was deployed to examine the relationship between the whole brain volume and the total score of the NPI.; ; ; Results; Compared with the control group, bvFTD patients showed abnormalities in most of the neuropsycological tests (all P<0.01), including the higher scores in NPI (Z=-6.545) , and the poor performance in global cognitive function (t=-8.621) , execution function (t=4.776) , episodic memory (t=-7.990) and visuospatial skills (Z=-4.909) . In addition, the volume of specific regions, including notably bilateral prefrontal and pre-temporal cortex, insula and subcortical structures, were significantly reduced in bvFTD group (t=4.89-10.95, P<0.05, FWE-corrected). Most prominent atrophy was observed in bilateral caudate nucleus, amygdala, pallidum, putamen, insula, and rectus gyrus. Moreover, the atrophy of left precuneus (cluster size=193 voxels, peak MNI coordinates x=-7.5, y=-66.0, z=67.5) was significantly associated with the total score of NPI (ρ=-0.515, P<0.05, AlphaSim corrected).; ; ; Conclusions; It indicates that the structure of cortico-striatal-thalamic circuits is compromised in bvFTD.

180-902-313-751-121,Structural brain abnormalities in first episode schizophrenia. Is it just illness,,2004,dissertation,,,,,M. Rais,"Although neuroimaging studies consistently demonstrated brain volume alterations in patients with schizophrenia, confounding factors like age, IQ, duration of the illness, use of antipsychotic medication and drug (ab-)use might partly explain these results. Therefore, the relation between confounding factors and brain morphology (together with white matter integrity) was investigated in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. To investigate the effects of cannabis (ab-)use on brain morphology, changes in brain volume and cortical thickness were measured over a 5-year interval in 19 cannabis-using first-episode schizophrenia patients, 32 non-using patients, and 31 cannabis-naive healthy subjects. Cannabis-using patients show a more pronounced brain volume reduction (as expressed by a more pronounced grey matter volume loss and increased vericular volume) over a 5-year follow-up as compared to non-using patients and healthy subjects. Moreover, although schizophrenia patients showed widespread cortical thinning along the cerebral cortex, cannabis-using patients showed additional thinning in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left anterior cingulate cortex and left occipital lobe. Interestingly, these areas are known for their high density of CB1 receptors particularly in schizophrenia patients. These results suggest that in first-episode patients with schizophrenia who continue to use cannabis after illness onset, it is particularly those cortical regions that are rich in CB1 receptors that are vulnerable to excessive cortical thinning. Numerous structural MRI studies and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have implicated brain tissue abnormalities in schizophrenia. However, the majority of these studies included patient populations that use anti-psychotic medication. To what extent the reported aberrations can be attributed to the disease rather than to the use of medication is still debated. Therefore, global brain volumes and white matter structure were investigated in antipsychotic naive patients. Ia a cross-sectional study, we compared global brain volumes and cortical thickness between 20 first-episode medication-naive schizophrenia patients and 26 healthy comparison subjects. Moreover DTI techniques were used to study white matter structure in a subgroup of the same sample with 16 medication-naive patients as compared to 23 healthy controls. Medication-naive patients showed smaller whole brain volume (as expressed by smaller grey and white matter volume) together with enlarged lateral ventricles. Moreover, a relationship between IQ and brain volume, irrespective of diagnosis, was found. Furthermore white matter microstructure, was altered particularly in the left arcuate fasciculus and the right uncinate fasciculus. These processes took place early in the disease process and cannot be attributed to the effects of antipsychotic medication. Finally, to investigate the relation between progressive brain volume changes and duration of psychosis in patients with schizophrenia, changes in global brain volumes were measured over a 5-year interval in 48 first-episode patients. This study shows that, in the first five years of schizophrenia, brain volume is related to the time patients are actively psychotic with more pronounced brain volume loss associated with longer duration of psychosis. This suggests that the progressive brain volume changes in schizophrenia are intrinsic to the illness and, more specifically, are related to the psychotic aspects of it.",,,,,Internal medicine; Brain morphometry; Diffusion MRI; Cardiology; Grey matter; Psychosis; Antipsychotic; White matter; Brain size; Medicine; Schizophrenia,,,,,https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/212942/rais.pdf;sequence=2 https://www.narcis.nl/research/RecordID/OND1299979 https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/1874/212942/2/rais.pdf http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/212942,https://www.narcis.nl/research/RecordID/OND1299979,,,1485612935,,0,000-923-757-971-665; 001-766-706-858-590; 002-260-574-341-685; 004-878-263-418-021; 008-764-997-763-756; 009-277-168-214-862; 011-043-839-177-004; 011-798-418-642-76X; 013-186-289-526-88X; 014-029-660-446-401; 020-115-563-538-513; 020-732-211-139-790; 021-721-275-918-227; 022-469-047-707-158; 027-235-938-875-104; 027-631-284-194-047; 034-215-049-038-651; 034-601-823-450-14X; 035-123-923-952-991; 038-695-280-115-745; 039-812-914-590-473; 039-864-415-772-664; 040-029-976-420-980; 041-408-325-415-308; 050-133-510-365-53X; 050-645-838-062-38X; 058-591-671-436-588; 070-402-783-633-518; 081-345-148-815-700; 084-427-128-662-346; 084-945-856-245-655; 089-014-295-999-217; 091-388-073-208-625; 093-679-291-759-735; 096-703-434-370-740; 107-466-604-573-606; 116-815-186-419-110; 143-226-737-964-670,1,false,,

Gilmore,"Background Increased volume of extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid (EA-CSF) is associated with autism spectrum disorder diagnosis in young children. However, little is known about EA-CSF development in typically developing (TD) children or in children at risk for schizophrenia (SCZHR). Methods 3T magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained in TD children (n = 105) and in SCZHR children (n = 38) at 1 and 2 years of age. EA-CSF volume and several measures of brain structure were generated, including global tissue volumes, cortical thickness, and surface area. Cognitive and motor abilities at 1 and 2 years of age were assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning. Results In the TD children, EA-CSF volume was positively associated with total brain volume, gray and white matter volumes, and total surface area at 1 and 2 years of age. In contrast, EA-CSF volume was negatively associated with average cortical thickness. Lower motor ability was associated with increased EA-CSF volume at 1 year of age. EA-CSF was not significantly increased in SCZHR children compared with TD children. Conclusions EA-CSF volume is positively associated with overall brain size and cortical surface area but negatively associated with cortical thickness. Increased EA-CSF is associated with delayed motor development at 1 year of age, similar to studies of children at risk for autism, suggesting that increased EA-CSF may be an early biomarker of abnormal brain development in infancy. Infants in the SCZHR group did not exhibit significantly increased EA-CSF, suggesting that increased EA-CSF could be specific to neurodevelopmental disorders with an earlier onset, such as autism.",5,7,651,659,Magnetic resonance imaging; Motor skill; Pediatrics; Autism; Autism spectrum disorder; Cerebrospinal fluid; White matter; Brain size; Medicine; Schizophrenia,Early brain development; Extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid; High risk; Infancy; MRI; Schizophrenia,Autism Spectrum Disorder; Brain; Cognition; Female; Humans; Infant; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Schizophrenia,,NIEHS NIH HHS (P30 ES010126) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (P50 HD103573) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (U54 HD079124) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (P30 HD003110) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (R01 MH070890) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (U01 MH070890) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (R01 MH091645) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (K12 HD001441) United States; NIGMS NIH HHS (R25 GM055336) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (P50 MH064065) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (T32 NS007431) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (R01 HD053000) United States,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S245190222030077X https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32457022 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32457022/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7366523,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2020.03.008,32457022,10.1016/j.bpsc.2020.03.008,3014501863,PMC7366523,0,000-924-811-066-004; 001-564-710-469-285; 004-689-298-675-092; 006-040-606-750-709; 007-367-385-900-590; 010-339-406-434-972; 011-250-915-561-588; 012-860-315-067-556; 012-998-325-766-248; 013-609-661-789-769; 015-171-135-395-101; 016-146-847-877-91X; 016-209-076-804-530; 019-905-139-461-482; 020-867-219-623-585; 021-084-796-646-715; 022-607-536-600-207; 023-824-892-315-338; 024-232-182-209-407; 024-310-581-666-788; 028-593-561-563-456; 032-902-864-177-22X; 033-812-471-705-607; 036-185-905-473-786; 042-658-884-078-983; 043-766-716-027-92X; 045-422-475-409-380; 048-635-389-669-758; 050-302-040-292-587; 057-821-480-968-084; 067-028-112-954-34X; 068-487-861-257-081; 081-976-829-577-585; 082-065-241-407-437; 087-301-556-379-630; 088-337-805-282-110; 089-246-800-591-216; 091-098-814-866-583; 092-598-541-453-800; 093-960-911-482-410; 094-055-909-095-928; 102-533-498-193-786; 123-522-906-543-991; 126-264-611-284-398,9,true,,green

These may partly stem from confounding bias, which could distort associations and limit generalizability. We examined how associations between brain morphology and ADHD symptoms change with adjustments for potential confounders typically overlooked in the literature (aim 1), and for the intelligence quotient (IQ) and head motion, which are generally corrected for but play ambiguous roles (aim 2). Methods: Participants were 10-year-old children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (N = 7722) and Generation R (N = 2531) Studies. Cortical area, volume, and thickness were measured with MRI and ADHD symptoms with the Child Behavior Checklist. Surface-based cross-sectional analyses were run. Results: ADHD symptoms related to widespread cortical regions when solely adjusting for demographic factors. Additional adjustments for socioeconomic and maternal behavioral confounders (aim 1) generally attenuated associations, as cluster sizes halved and effect sizes substantially reduced. Cluster sizes further changed when including IQ and head motion (aim 2), however, we argue that adjustments might have introduced bias. Conclusions: Careful confounder selection and control can help identify more robust and specific regions of associations for ADHD symptoms, across two cohorts. We provided guidance to minimizing confounding bias in psychiatric neuroimaging.

Editor's evaluation This study provides important and useful information to researchers in brain morphology and ADHD. The strength of the evidence presented is convincing and solid. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.78002.sa0 Decision letter Reviews on Sciety eLife's review process Introduction Large strides have been made in the identification of neuroanatomical correlates of psychiatric problems, with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) being a prominent example. ADHD is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in children worldwide and is characterized by atypical levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Structural magnetic resonance imaging studies have highlighted that children with ADHD show widespread morphological differences, such as in the basal ganglia (Nakao et al., 2011), subcortical areas (Hoogman et al., 2017), and frontal, cingulate, and temporal cortices, compared to children without the disorder (Hoogman et al., 2019; Shaw et al., 2013). Consistently identifying the neuroanatomical substrate of ADHD, however, remains challenging. A recent meta-analysis did not find convergence across the literature on brain differences in children and adolescents with ADHD (Samea et al., 2019). One possible explanation for this inconsistency is the multifaceted nature of ADHD, in which children with the disorder have heterogeneous presentations on several cognitive and emotional domains, which could stem from distinct brain structural substrates. Other explanations regard study design. If suboptimal, it may lead to biased estimates and lack of generalizability, thus potentially concealing robust and replicable relations of brain morphology with ADHD. The present study focuses on confounding, a common source of bias in etiological studies. Confounding bias arises when a third variable affects both the determinant (independent variable) and outcome (dependent variable) of interest (i.e., is a common cause) (VanderWeele, 2019). Confounding leads to over- or underestimation of the true effect between determinant and outcome and can even change the direction of an association. To minimize confounding bias, appropriate confounder control is paramount, although it is challenging, especially in observational studies like most neuroimaging studies of ADHD. Previous literature and expert knowledge can guide the identification of potential confounders (Hernan and Robins, 2020), which can then be appropriately adjusted for in regression models or using methods such as restriction, standardization, or propensity scores. Within neuroimaging studies of ADHD, except for a few large investigations (Hoogman et al., 2017; Mous et al., 2014; Bernanke et al., 2022), studies have generally matched or adjusted for a few demographic variables (e.g., age and sex) and neuroimaging metrics or parameters. Of the 19 studies included in a systematic review of neuroimaging studies on ADHD (Saad et al., 2020), 17 adjusted or matched for age in their analyses, 14 for sex, 9 for neuroimaging-related variables like head motion during scanning, and 8 for the intelligence quotient (IQ) (Supplementary file 1a). Further potential confounders should, however, be considered. For instance, socioeconomic status (SES) is related to both higher risk for ADHD and variation in cortical brain structure (Russell et al., 2016; Noble et al., 2015). Thus, it is likely a confounder. Lack of adjustment for SES may have therefore concealed key relations between ADHD and brain structure. Adjustment choices are dependent on the availability of large samples with data on a wide variety of covariates, which has to date been limited for psychiatric neuroimaging studies. Yet, this is rapidly changing with the advent of population neuroscience, which entails large-scale studies with neurobiological data. This lends new opportunities for further confounder adjustments to be considered in neuroimaging studies of ADHD. Conversely, previous studies have adjusted for IQ and head motion, which may not be confounders in the association between ADHD symptoms and the brain, and may thus have led to further bias in the results (Dennis et al., 2009). In this study, we examined the association between brain structure and ADHD symptoms and how the selection and control for potential confounders may affect results (aim 1). Moreover, we discussed the complex role of IQ and head motion in brain structure–ADHD associations and the potential consequences of adjusting for them (aim 2). We leveraged two large, population-based cohorts: the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and the Generation R Studies. In line with most neuroimaging studies, we adopted a cross-sectional design. Results Associations between ADHD symptoms and brain morphology are widespread We analyzed data from 10-year-old children from the ABCD (N = 7722, multisite) and Generation R (N = 2531, single-site) Studies (Supplementary file 1b). ADHD symptoms were measured with the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL). T1-weighted images were obtained with 3T scanners (Casey et al., 2018; Kooijman et al., 2016). We ran vertex-wise linear regression models for ADHD with cortical surface area, volume, and thickness. Results for surface area, which constituted the main findings here, are presented in-text, while findings for volume and thickness in the figure supplements. We adjusted for demographic and study characteristics which have been generally considered by previous literature (Supplementary file 1a): age, sex, ethnicity, and study site (ABCD only). We refer to this model as model 1, as further adjustments for confounders are outlined in subsequent steps. We found that higher ADHD symptoms were associated with less bilateral surface area in both cohorts. As shown in Figure 1, associations were widespread, as the clusters of association covered 1165.7 cm2 of the cerebral cortex in the ABCD Study, and 446.1 cm2 in the Generation R Study. Across both cohorts, we consistently identified clusters for surface area in the lateral occipital, postcentral, rostral middle and superior frontal, and superior parietal cortices. For cortical thickness, we found two small frontal clusters in the ABCD Study (16.1 cm2) and no clusters in the Generation R Study, which suggests that cortical thickness does not relate or does not relate strongly to ADHD, in line with prior literature (Hoogman et al., 2019; Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Figure 1 with 2 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Significant clusters in the association of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms with cortical surface area based on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and Generation R Studies, for model 1. Note. Rows represent the results for the ABCD or Generation R Studies, and the columns represent the left and right hemispheres. Regions in red represent significant clusters from model 1 (adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and site [ABCD only]). Confounder selection: socioeconomic and maternal behavioral factors Next, we considered factors that have been previously linked to ADHD and brain structure in the literature, and are thus potential confounders. To illustrate this background knowledge and the assumptions about relations between variables, we used Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), a type of causal diagram (Hernan and Robins, 2020). These guide the identification (and dismissal) of covariates that may act as confounders. Of note, while assumptions may not hold, this theoretical approach is preferred to methods selecting confounders based on model statistics (Lee, 2014). The DAGs are depicted in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2, and the rationales for variable inclusion are explained below and in the Methods. Figure 2 with 2 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for brain structure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms (simplified). Note. DAGs illustrating potential confounders in the association between brain structure and ADHD symptoms for three sequential models. Model 1 included demographic and study characteristics: sex, age, ethnicity, and study site (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development [ABCD] only) (in blue). Model 2 additionally included socioeconomic status factors: family income, maternal education, and maternal age at childbirth (in red). Model 3 additionally incorporated postnatal maternal psychopathology and maternal substance use during pregnancy (in green). Based on the literature, lower SES is associated with a higher risk for ADHD (Russell et al., 2016) and with variation in cortical brain structure (Noble et al., 2015). Thus, confounding by socioeconomic factors in the relation between ADHD and brain morphology is likely. We therefore additionally adjusted for a second set of confounders (model 2) related to SES: household income, maternal education, and maternal age at childbirth. Moreover, several factors concerning maternal behavior, pre- and postnatally, have been associated with both ADHD and brain morphology. For instance, prenatal exposure to substances is known to increase the risk of developing ADHD symptoms and has been associated with variation in cerebral volume and surface area (Eilertsen et al., 2017; Lees et al., 2020). Postnatal maternal psychopathology has been linked to higher child ADHD symptoms (Clavarino et al., 2010) and smaller brain volume in children (Zou et al., 2019). Thus, in model 3 we additionally adjusted for prenatal exposure to substance use (tobacco and cannabis), and postnatal maternal psychopathology. Adjusting for additional confounders led to reductions in the clusters of association Adjustments for SES (model 2) led to reductions in the spatial extent of the clusters for surface area and volume in both cohorts (Figure 3). For surface area, cluster sizes for ADHD symptoms reduced from 1165.7 cm2 in model 1 to 952.8 cm2 in model 2 (=−18%) in the ABCD Study, and from 446.1 to 229.6 cm2 (=−49%) in the Generation R Study. Similar reductions were observed for volume and thickness (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). After adjusting for the confounders added in model 3, across both cohorts, we consistently identified clusters for surface area in the cuneus, precuneus, fusiform, inferior parietal, isthmus of the cingulate, pericalcarine, pre- and postcentral, rostral middle and superior frontal, superior temporal and supramarginal cortices.

Note. Rows represent the results for the ABCD or Generation R Studies, and the columns represent the left and right hemispheres. The colors denote the different models. Regions in red represent significant clusters from model 1 (sex, age, race/ethnicity, and site [ABCD only]), orange from model 2 (model 1 + family income, maternal education, and maternal age at childbirth), and yellow from model 3 (model 2 + maternal smoking, substance use during pregnancy, psychopathology). Similar results were observed for ADHD diagnosis To explore whether the results observed for associations between brain morphology and ADHD symptoms applied to children with an ADHD diagnosis, we repeated the primary analysis using the ADHD diagnostic data from the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (KSADS) in the ABCD Study. In line with our primary results, ADHD diagnosis was associated with less bilateral surface area and volume. Compared to clusters for ADHD symptoms, those associated with ADHD diagnosis were smaller, but overlapping (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We observed similar patterns of reduction in the spatial extent of the clusters after adjusting for each set of confounders (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). For surface area, cluster sizes for ADHD symptoms covered 234.4 cm2 in model 1 and reduced to 199.5 cm2 in model 2 (=−15%), and 55.5 cm2 in model 3 (=−72%, compared to model 2). Beta coefficients generally decreased after confounder adjustments, but may also increase Surface-based studies generally focus on the spatial extent of cortical clusters associated with the phenotype, but, in this study, we also explored how confounding adjustments affected the regression coefficients for ADHD symptoms (Figure 4). Figure 4 with 5 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Region-based average regression coefficients for surface area in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and Generation R Studies. Note. The colors denote the different models, and the circles denote the average of all the betas within that region. The regions are based on the Desikan–Killiany atlas. Results for the ABCD and Generation R Studies are, respectively, shown on the top and bottom. At a vertex-wise level, adjusting for socioeconomic and maternal factors (model 3) led to reductions in the beta coefficients, across the brain, for both cohorts (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Of note, some beta coefficients also showed increases. As confounding bias may lead to under- or overestimation, it is not surprising to observe both decreases and increases in the average beta coefficients after adjustments. At an anatomical region level, where estimates of vertices within a given Desikan–Killiany region were averaged, beta coefficients for surface area tended to decrease from model 1 to 2 by approximately 15% (Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Further adjustments from model 2 to 3 led to decreases in the average beta coefficients of certain regions and increases in others. Similar patterns were found for volume (Figure 4—figure supplements 3 and 4). The average beta coefficients per region correlated moderately to strongly between the ABCD and Generation R Studies for surface area (Spearman rM1 = 0.84, rM2 = 0.83, rM3 = 0.83) and volume (Spearman rM1 = 0.57, rM2 = 0.57, rM3 = 0.70) (Figure 4—figure supplement 5). IQ may be a confounder, mediator, or collider in neuroanatomical studies of ADHD We considered one additional scenario which included IQ, a factor that is often adjusted for in previous studies (Supplementary file 1a). However, based on prior literature, it holds an ambiguous role in structural anatomy–ADHD relations. Previous studies found that children with ADHD scored lower on IQ than children without ADHD (Bridgett and Walker, 2006). Differential brain structure with levels of IQ has also been shown (Mcdaniel, 2005). However, the directions of causation between these variables remain unclear (Gallo and Posner, 2016). IQ may therefore be a confounder, collider, and/or mediator in the relation between brain structure and ADHD, as depicted in the DAGs in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1. Figure 5 with 1 supplement see all Download asset Open asset Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for intelligence quotient (IQ), brain structure, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Note. (A) DAG for IQ as a confounder. In this case, adjustments are needed as the backdoor path from brain structure to ADHD symptoms through IQ is open. By adjusting (box around IQ), the path gets closed. (B) DAG for IQ as a mediator. Adjustments are not needed to estimate the total effect of brain structure on ADHD symptoms. (C) DAG for IQ as a collider. The backdoor path through IQ is already closed. Adjustments would open the path and lead to collider bias. First, it could be argued that IQ is partly innate and precedes brain development and ADHD, making it a confounder (Figure 5A). Second, IQ may lie in the pathway between brain structure and ADHD and therefore act as a mediator (Figure 5B). It is conceivable that cognitive differences, as a consequence of subtle neurodevelopmental differences (Lee et al., 2019), could underlie ADHD. Adjusting for a mediator would lead to bias when estimating the total association between brain structure and ADHD (VanderWeele, 2016). Third, brain structure may impact intelligence scores (Lee et al., 2019), and ADHD symptoms may affect IQ test performance (Jepsen et al., 2009; Figure 5C). A variable that is independently caused by the outcome and the determinant is also known as a collider, and adjusting for it leads to (collider) bias. Here, we explored the impact of adjusting for IQ when examining the relation between brain morphology and ADHD (model 4). Adjustments for IQ led to further cluster reductions After additionally adjusting for IQ, the spatial extent of the clusters associated with ADHD symptoms reduced further in both cohorts (Figure 6). For surface area, compared to model 3, clusters reduced from 760.2 to 605.1 cm2 (=−20%) for the ABCD Study, and from 208.6 to 93.1 cm2 for the Generation R Study (=−55%). Clusters of association for surface area in model 4 were located in the fusiform, inferior parietal, insula, lateral occipital, middle temporal, pericalcarine, pre- and postcentral, precuneus, rostral middle, and superior frontal, superior parietal and temporal, and supramarginal cortices. Findings for volume and thickness are shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.

Note. Rows represent the results for the ABCD or Generation R Studies, and the columns represent the left and right hemispheres. The colors denote the different models, with red vertices being significant only in model 3, orange ones in both model 3 and after adjustment for IQ, and yellow ones only after adjusting for IQ. Head motion does not induce confounding bias, but information bias A final scenario was also included, to reflect the commonly used adjustments for head motion during scanning (Supplementary file 1a). Motion can be a large source of bias in neuroimaging studies which is important to address. While it does not meet the criteria for confounding as it is not a common cause of ADHD problems and brain morphology (Hernan and Robins, 2020), head motion can induce measurement error of brain morphology (Van de Walle et al., 1997; Figure 7). This is also referred to as information bias and can distort estimates from their true value. Figure 7 Download asset Open asset Information bias for brain structure, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, and head motion. Note. From the bottom up: We aim to measure the ‘true’ values of brain structure and ADHD symptoms. However, we actually measure both brain structure and ADHD symptoms imperfectly, at the MRI and through self-reports, respectively. What we assess is therefore affected by measurement errors. Error in the MRI measurement is determined, in part, by excessive motion during scanning. Higher ADHD symptoms likely cause higher motion (dotted red path). This leads to differential information bias and creates a non-causal path from ADHD symptoms to brain structure through motion. The amount of measurement error in brain morphology may differ across children with versus without ADHD. In fact, children with impulsivity and inattention have been shown to move more during MRI scanning (Thomson et al., 2021; Kong et al., 2014), determining different levels of error in the brain morphology assessments (Figure 7, path from ADHD symptoms to motion to error in MRI measurement). In this scenario, adjusting for motion might lead to two situations. On one hand, since motion is a consequence of the outcome (ADHD), adjustments would lead to bias (Westreich, 2012). On the other hand, not adjusting for motion would also lead to bias because part of the observed relation between ADHD symptoms and brain structure would be due to the higher head motion (and thus the underestimation of the cortical values) of children with ADHD. In this study, we explored the effect of adjusting for motion during scanning in the relation between brain morphology and ADHD (model 5). Adjustments for head motion led to increases in clusters After additional adjustments for head motion, the spatial extent of the clusters generally increased. For surface area, compared to model 3, clusters increased from 760.2 to 936.4 cm2 (=+23.2%) for the ABCD Study and from 208.6 to 239.7 cm2 (=+14.9%) for the Generation R Study (Figure 8). Clusters of associations consistently found across cohorts were highly similar to the ones identified in model 3. Results for cortical volume and thickness are shown in Figure 8—figure supplement 1.

Note. Rows represent the results for the ABCD or Generation R Studies, and the columns represent the left and right hemispheres. The colors denote the different models, with red vertices being significant only in model 3, orange ones in both model 3 and after adjustment for motion, and yellow ones only after adjusting for motion. Discussion By leveraging two large population-based studies and adopting a literature- and DAG-informed approach to address confounding, we showed that (1) associations between brain structure and ADHD symptoms, which were initially widespread, reduced when adjusting for socioeconomic and maternal behavioral confounders, and that (2) careful considerations are needed when including IQ and/or head motion due to their complex relation with ADHD and brain morphology. Adjustments for confounders highlighted key regions of association, observed across two large cohorts Widespread associations between surface area and ADHD symptoms were initially identified, with higher symptoms relating to smaller brain structures, in line with previous research (Hoogman et al., 2019; Gehricke et al., 2017). After adjustments for potential confounders typically overlooked by prior literature (socioeconomic and maternal behavioral factors), approximately half of the associations remained, and considerable effect size changes were observed in both the ABCD and Generation R Studies and for all cortical measures. We observed similar patterns of cluster reductions for ADHD diagnosis in the ABCD Study. Regions that remained associated after adjustments and which were consistently identified across cohorts were the precuneus, isthmus of the cingulate, supramarginal, pre- and postcentral, and inferior parietal cortices for both area and volume. Most of these regions (e.g., supramarginal) have been previously implicated in ADHD in clinical samples (Saad et al., 2017; Lei et al., 2014; Solanto et al., 2009). However, many different brain areas have been detected in association with the disorder (Saad et al., 2020), which may have hampered prior meta-analytic efforts to identify consistent neuroanatomical correlates for ADHD. Of note, some inconsistencies between the ABCD and Generation R Studies, both in size of the clusters and the exact location, were observed. While we used the same processing pipelines and similar quality control procedures and measures across cohorts, potential reasons for discrepancies in results must be discussed. First, the larger sample size of the ABCD Study allows for greater power to detect smaller effects, which led to larger associated areas. Second, the multisite structure of the ABCD Study may have introduced noise in the results (e.g., by different scanners, demographic differences), and determined the identification of associations which are not replicable in the Generation R Study. Third, the two studies include children from different populations. While both are very diverse samples, the ABCD Study is comprised of a more heterogeneous sample from the US population, which, for instance, is characterized by a wider variety of ethnicities and cultures, potentially permitting the discovery of more associations. Nevertheless, there was considerable overlap in the findings from the ABCD and Generation R Studies, with consistencies across cohorts indicating the most robust and generalizable associations. Here, we discerned associated areas likely subject to confounding bias from areas robust to socioeconomic and maternal behavioral factors, and replicable across two large cohorts. Comparisons with prior findings should be made with caution due to differences in study design, samples (clinical vs. population-based), and analytical methods. Importantly, we highlighted the opportunity for future studies to include covariates that go beyond age and sex, can help refine associations, and can be readily collected. Future studies may want to consider other confounding factors, depending on their research question, design, and assumed causal relations. Adjustments for IQ are often unnecessary when examining the relation between brain structure and ADHD Avoiding bias from adjusting for variables that are not confounders is as important as identifying sources of confounding. Adjusting for mediators or colliders of the ADHD–brain structure relation would induce bias. Here, when adjusting for IQ, which plays an unclear role in brain structure–ADHD associations, cluster sizes reduced considerably in both the ABCD and Generation R Studies. This could indicate that IQ is a confounder, in which case adjustments would be necessary, or that IQ is a mediator or collider, in which case adjustments must be avoided. First, based on previous literature and this study, the association between ADHD and IQ is relatively weak (Dennis et al., 2009) (rABCD = −0.11, rGENR = −0.14), but this does not necessarily make it a weak confounder as the strength of confounding is due to a variable’s relation with the exposure and outcome. Second, if brain structure and ADHD symptoms both cause cognitive changes, adjusting for IQ could induce collider bias, although this is also dependent on when IQ is measured relative to the exposure and outcome (Hernan and Robins, 2020). Third, if brain structure determines cognitive functioning, which in turn affects ADHD symptoms (mediation by IQ), adjustments would also induce bias (VanderWeele, 2016). Given these scenarios, we recommend moving away from routinely adjusting for IQ in ADHD neuroimaging studies, and we highlight the need to carefully consider the causal model for a specific research question to determine whether IQ may confound associations. There is no easy fix for dealing with head motion in brain morphology–ADHD associations Adjustments for neuroimaging covariates, such as head motion, are often run to reduce confounding bias. However, head motion, rather than inducing confounding bias, creates measurement error (information bias). When adjusting for head motion during scanning, we observed increases in the spatial extent of the clusters. This might indicate a reduction or an increase in bias. First, bias might have been reduced by adjusting for the fact that children with ADHD will have more error in their cortical measures.

The wide range in prevalence of PSCI stems from the nonuniform definition of PSCI as well as varying duration of follow-up poststroke (Melkas et al., 2014). It is also important to note that due to the heterogeneous nature of strokes in terms of lesion location, lesion size, burden of pre-existing small vessel disease and concomitant neurodegenerative pathology, the presentation and natural history of PSCI can be complex.Temporally, cognitive symptoms may emerge soon after a stroke (early PSCI) or many months later (late PSCI) (Levine et al., 2015; Lo et al., 2023). While early PSCI is more likely to be recognized and evaluated as cognitive symptoms begin while patients are still in the health care environment, late PSCI often goes undetected with patients having to live with cognitive difficulties for prolonged periods of time before eventually seeking treatment. Late PSCI typically starts 3–6 months poststroke although it can even manifest much later (Lo et al., 2022).Clinicians should also be mindful that intact cognition in the acute phase is not predictive of long-term cognitive performance, as there is likely to be changes in cerebral perfusion and brain connectivity over time, which could result in fluctuations in cognition later on (Ballard et al., 2003). In view of this natural history, there is a need to put systems in place to ensure that patients are reviewed and evaluated for cognitive symptoms periodically after a stroke. High-risk patients such as older patients and those with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease should be prioritized for periodic evaluation of cognitive function. Scales such as the CHANGE score may be useful in this regard as it allows for cognitive risk stratification of stroke patients at the point of their acute stroke event (Chander et al., 2017).Presenting symptoms can include cognitive and behavioral symptoms (Yatawara et al., 2018). Common cognitive symptoms include executive dysfunction and impaired processing speed (Sachdev et al., 2004). Patients often realize that they take longer to complete their tasks and have trouble with judgment and planning. Often, these symptoms become more evident when patients return to their occupation or become socially active again. In addition to these cognitive symptoms, a majority of patients may also develop isolated behavioral symptoms or behavioral symptoms concomitant to cognitive symptoms.Behavioral symptoms could include apathy, depression, and aggressive behavior among others. From a pathobiological perspective, early PSCI is likely related to disruption of the brain connectivity, whereas late PSCI has been associated with burden of cerebral small vessel disease and neurodegenerative pathology such as amyloid-β and tau pathology (Mok et al., 2017; Yatawara et al., 2020a). Specifically, white matter hyperintensities and microbleeds have been strongly correlated to incidence of PSCI (Wilson et al., 2019; Yatawara et al., 2020b).In this issue of the journal, Baogen Du et al. report their findings on cerebral perfusion in patients who suffered a nondisabling ischemic stroke having intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAS). They compared cerebral perfusion using magnetic resonance imaging pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) as well as neuropsychological performance in 47 stroke patients having ICAS compared with controls. They specifically studied spatial coefficient of variation (sCoV) of pCASL-based blood flow (CBF) images to explore abnormal cerebral perfusion. All participants underwent global and individual neuropsychological assessments and magnetic resonance imaging scan.They report that CBF in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory of the lesion side decreased significantly, whereas it increased on the contralateral side. CBF value was also significantly correlated with the memory function in the right MCA lesion group. They demonstrate that the sCoV values increased in both gray matter (GM) and the ipsilateral MCA territory of the lesion and that these sCoV values were significantly correlated with global cognitive function, memory function, and executive function in patients with ICAS. They conclude that sCoV could be a better indicator of cognitive impairment than CBF and that interventions to relieve vascular stenosis or occlusion could potentially delay cognitive impairment.This study adds to the growing literature that cognitive symptoms poststroke are more directly correlated with cerebral perfusion in the poststroke phase and may be less dependent on the area of the infarction. The presence of steno-occlusive cerebrovascular disease has been associated with delays in arterial transit time (ATT) due to decreases in perfusion pressure as well as decreased CBF (Ibaraki et al., 2019).Preliminary studies quantifying sCoV show associations between increasing sCoV magnitude with worsening cognitive function (Morgan et al., 2021). In addition, increasing sCoV of GM is also strongly correlated with decreased CBF, further supporting delayed perfusion effects (Morgan et al., 2021). Thus, the sCoV of pCASL CBF imaging can be a reliable measure of hemodynamic status to predict prolonged ATT in stroke patients (Ibaraki et al., 2019; Mutsaerts et al., 2020; Mutsaerts et al., 2017).Previous work has also suggested that the burden of prestroke cerebral small vessel disease is a major factor that determines development of PSCI. High burdens of pre-existing cerebral small vessel disease could alter global cerebral perfusion, which becomes further compromised after an acute stenosis of intracranial vessels related to the stroke event.Although stroke is associated with lower perfusion throughout the GM, reduced CBF in regions involved in cognitive functioning as measured by Arterial Spin Labeling imaging has been consistently reported in studies on stroke survivors and poststroke dementia (Brumm et al., 2010; Firbank et al., 2011; Schuff et al., 2009). Deficits in CBF may occur either at baseline or as abnormally long transit delays, both of which may affect tissue viability and subsequently impact cognitive functioning (Brumm et al., 2010; Hillis, 2007).Indeed, such global hypoperfusion has been further associated with vascular cognitive decline (Schuff et al., 2009). In addition, individuals with poststroke dementia show greater burden of vascular pathology as determined by white matter hyperintensity volume and associated cortical hypoperfusion illustrating possible mechanisms underlying PSCI (Firbank et al., 2011). This combination of white matter hyperintensities, lower brain volume, and impaired cognitive ability poststroke strongly predict increased risk of future dementia due to collective vascular dysfunction (Firbank et al., 2011; Savva and Stephan, 2010).In addition, longitudinal parietal and global CBF deficits have also been shown to appear up to 6 years poststroke, indicating sustained vascular disruption (Firbank et al., 2011). Further studies examining cerebral perfusion with CBF measures, ATT measures, and sCOV in patients with lacunar strokes and large vessel strokes could shed light on the natural history of PSCI, allowing for better monitoring strategies and development of interventions that target cerebral perfusion poststroke.Another article in this issue by Erin L. Meier et al. examined connectivity changes and language impairment poststroke. This is timely research, given that aphasia remains a major neurological deficit poststroke, resulting in poor functional status and interferes with the rehabilitation process. This study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to study aphasia poststroke. Resting state functional connectivity changes were compared between patients with early poststroke aphasia and neurological healthy adults using the preprocessed oxyhemoglobin (Hbo) data derived from fNIRS.Using a 46-channel montage centered over bilateral perisylvian areas, the authors demonstrated that patients with aphasia had reduced global resting state connectivity across all Hbo-based connections compared with healthy controls. These findings are in keeping with the connectivity changes that occur after an acute stroke event. fNIRS may be relatively more accessible in clinical settings and thus could be integrated in the evaluation of patients with PSCI.PSCI remains a major complication of strokes with debilitating consequence on stroke survivors and their families. The fluctuations in cognitive symptoms over time related to changes in cerebral perfusion and brain connectivity are key mechanisms that require further longitudinal studies. A deeper understanding of the perfusion-connectivity changes poststroke will provide for better prediction models for PSCI, which will in turn allow for more accurate selection of stroke patients for close monitoring of cognition as well as those that may benefit from intensive vascular and cognitive enhancer therapies.ReferencesBallard C, Rowan E, Stephens S, et al. 2003.

Mofrad; Hauke Bartsch; Alexander S. Lundervold,"We propose a method of constructing representations of multiple one-dimensional longitudinal measurements as two-dimensional grey-scale images. This can be used to turn classification problems based on longitudinal data into simpler image classification problems, allowing image-based deep learning methods to be applied to longitudinal measurements. Our approach is applicable to situations with balanced or imbalanced longitudinal data sets and where there are missing data at some time points. To evaluate our approach, we apply it to an important and challenging task: the prediction of dementia from brain volume trajectories derived from longitudinal MRI. We construct an ensemble of convolutional neural network models to classify two groups of subjects: those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment at all examinations (stable MCI) versus those starting out as MCI but later converting to Alzheimer’s disease (converted AD). Models were trained on image representations derived from $$N=736$$ subjects sourced from the ADNI database (471/265 sMCI/cAD). We obtained an accuracy of a resulting ensemble model of $$76\%$$ , measured on an independent test set. Our approach is simple and easy to apply but competitive (in terms of accuracy), with results reported in other machine learning approaches with similar classification on comparable tasks. This indicates that this approach can lead to useful representations of longitudinal data.",,,577,592,Disease; Longitudinal study; Psychology; Neuroscience; Medicine; Pathology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-47718-8_39,,10.1007/978-3-031-47718-8_39,,,0,000-275-161-156-579; 004-510-927-863-908; 006-912-106-456-314; 008-089-841-162-480; 009-329-938-347-509; 010-215-605-632-598; 019-177-581-499-27X; 020-233-013-143-936; 022-502-485-242-532; 023-852-075-315-598; 024-439-083-363-36X; 025-429-632-617-412; 028-696-653-010-949; 030-896-221-081-354; 035-408-710-879-945; 035-951-566-153-537; 037-657-070-860-516; 038-538-778-244-641; 040-024-868-201-542; 045-056-444-872-922; 051-355-078-161-238; 055-229-363-245-690; 061-871-494-039-446; 063-431-936-153-996; 067-037-758-249-070; 069-463-964-424-217; 073-037-520-583-156; 073-793-218-622-47X; 094-886-404-498-120; 131-423-542-523-282; 136-858-476-885-465; 138-831-093-878-471; 140-811-458-058-788; 147-285-090-437-276; 148-312-311-353-816; 151-526-061-560-012; 152-736-631-096-509,0,false,,

Jack,"Objective: We used imaging markers of neuronal injury and ischemic damage to investigate associations of diabetes and hypertension with imaging biomarkers and cognition in a non-demented, population-based cohort.;  Background: The mechanisms underlying the association of diabetes and hypertension with cognitive impairment are not completely understood. Methods: Participants (n= 1,437, median age 80 years) were evaluated by a nurse and physician, and underwent neuropsychological testing. A diagnosis of cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia was made by an expert panel. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging to determine cortical and subcortical infarctions, white matter hyperintensity (WMH), hippocampal (HV), and whole brain (WBV) volumes. The medical records were reviewed for diabetes and hypertension in mid-life or later. Results: Mid-life diabetes was associated with subcortical infarctions (odds ratio, 1.85 [95% confidence interval, 1.09, 3.15]; p = 0.02), reduced HV (-4%, [-7, -1.0]; p = 0.01), reduced WBV (-2.9% [-4.1, -1.6]), and with prevalent MCI (OR, 2.08, p = 0.01). The association between diabetes and MCI persisted with adjustment for infarctions and WMH volume, but was attenuated after adjustment for WBV (1.60, [0.87, 2.95]; p = 0.13) and HV (1.82, [1.00, 3.32]; p = 0.05). Mid-life hypertension was associated with infarctions, WMH volume, and marginally associated with reduced performance in executive function. Effects of late-life onset were few.;  Conclusions: Mid-life onset of diabetes may impact late-life cognition through loss of brain volume. Mid-life hypertension may impact executive function through ischemic pathology. Late-life onset of these conditions had fewer effects on brain pathology and cognition.

Detecting AD in all its presymptomatic and symptomatic stages is crucial for early intervention and treatment. An active research direction is to explore machine learning methods that harness multimodal data fusion to outperform human inspection of medical scans. However, existing multimodal fusion models have limitations, including redundant computation, complex architecture, and simplistic handling of missing data. Moreover, the preprocessing pipelines of medical scans remain inadequately detailed and are seldom optimized for individual subjects. In this paper, we propose an efficient early-late fusion (ELF) approach, which leverages a convolutional neural network for automated feature extraction and random forests for their competitive performance on small datasets. Additionally, we introduce a robust preprocessing pipeline that adapts to the unique characteristics of individual subjects and makes use of whole brain images rather than slices or patches. Moreover, to tackle the challenge of detecting subtle changes in brain volume, we transform images into the Jacobian domain (JD) to enhance both accuracy and robustness in our classification. Using MRI and CT images from the OASIS-3 dataset, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the ELF approach in classifying AD into four stages with an accuracy of 97.19%.",,,,,Computer science; Preprocessor; Artificial intelligence; Robustness (evolution); Convolutional neural network; Random forest; Feature extraction; Machine learning; Deep learning; Population; Sensor fusion; Pattern recognition (psychology); Medicine; Biochemistry; Environmental health; Gene; Chemistry,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16936,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2310.16936,,10.48550/arxiv.2310.16936,,,0,,0,true,other-oa,green

Vann,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>While the frontal cortices and medial temporal lobe are well-associated with schizophrenia, the involvement of wider limbic areas is less clear. The mammillary bodies are important for both complex memory formation and anxiety and are implicated in several neurological disorders that present with memory impairments. However, little is known about their role in schizophrenia. Post-mortem studies have reported both a loss of neurons in the mammillary bodies but also reports of increased mammillary body volume. The findings from<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>MRI studies have also been mixed, but studies have typically only involved small sample sizes. To address this, we acquired mammillary body volumes from the open-source COBRE dataset, where we were able to manually measure the mammillary bodies in 72 individuals with a schizophrenia diagnosis and 74 controls. Participant age ranged from 18-65. We found the mammillary bodies to be smaller in the patient group, across both hemispheres, after accounting for the effects of total brain volume and gender. Hippocampal volumes, but not subiculum or total grey matter volumes, were also significantly lower in patients. Given the importance of the mammillary bodies for both memory and anxiety, this atrophy could contribute to the symptomology in schizophrenia.</jats:p>",,,,,Mammillary body; Subiculum; Hippocampus; Psychology; Neuroscience; Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming); Thalamus; Temporal lobe; Hippocampal formation; Psychiatry; Dentate gyrus; Epilepsy,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2023/06/14/2023.06.13.544746.full.pdf https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.13.544746 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-023-00376-7.pdf https://doi.org/10.1038/s41537-023-00376-7 https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/449691/s41537_023_00376_7.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/449691 https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/161210/4/41537_2023_Article_376%20%281%29.pdf https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/161210/ https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/161210/4/41537_2023_Article_376%20%281%29.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.13.544746,,10.1101/2023.06.13.544746,,,0,002-612-143-267-870; 018-427-974-453-988; 019-921-794-446-764; 023-029-037-321-777; 029-910-535-416-172; 035-408-710-879-945; 035-988-621-351-755; 039-129-283-407-84X; 040-055-977-826-615; 041-528-613-682-896; 042-419-345-420-809; 043-586-740-451-183; 044-671-558-785-067; 045-256-584-237-572; 052-027-841-835-253; 064-272-541-364-239; 070-183-480-071-063; 074-293-883-997-998; 086-767-560-168-332; 090-812-504-226-360; 092-945-483-843-213; 098-950-047-388-773; 101-171-276-460-71X; 102-390-037-622-095; 103-402-499-602-648; 116-948-187-219-160; 131-377-409-991-074; 143-603-499-633-008; 149-043-457-163-541,0,true,cc-by-nc-nd,green

193-527-009-217-557,Assessing preparedness for Alzheimer disease-modifying therapies in Australasian health care systems.,2023-03-19,2023,journal article,The Medical journal of Australia,13265377; 0025729x,Australasian Medical Publishing Co. Ltd,Australia,Amy Brodtmann; David Darby; Carly Oboudiyat; Colin J Mahoney; Campbell Le Heron; Peter K Panegyres; Bruce Brew,"Therapeutic advancement is well underway, and the medical community needs to keep pace A further potential disease-modifying therapy (DMT), lecanemab, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of early Alzheimer disease in January 2023, with accompanying media releases on both the licensing company's commitment to safety and appropriate pricing.4, 5 An application for approval has been lodged in Australia. These therapies are costly and not without risk. Three deaths have been reported related to treatment with lecanemab.6 Patients receiving DMT require frequent monitoring with MRI brain scans (four or more per year), as there is a high rate of clinically significant amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), both brain oedema (ARIA-E) and macro- and microhaemorrhages (ARIA-H). Although most cases of ARIA are asymptomatic, close monitoring with MRI is mandated.7 So far, these therapies have been associated with increased brain volume loss (ie, increased brain atrophy). In addition, they require fortnightly or monthly intravenous infusions, and infusion reactions are common.2, 4 There are an estimated 487 500 persons living with all forms of dementia in Australia, at least half of whom have Alzheimer disease.8 Are we ready for DMTs in Australasia? In this article, we consider the readiness of the dementia community, highlight gaps in our health care systems, and provide recommendations for increasing workforce capacity and capability. We note that aducanumab meets only the first (and weakest) of these criteria: it uncontestably removes cortical fibrillar amyloid.2, 9, 10 Lecanemab was strongly positive for its primary (change from baseline to 18 months on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes [CDR-SOB], –0.45) and secondary endpoints (change in amyloid burden on PET, –59.1 centiloids),4 but note that a one- to two-point change on the CDR-SOB is regarded as a minimally clinically important difference.11 These debates have prompted much introspection from clinicians involved in the care of people with dementia, especially regarding DMT readiness and workforce capacity.9 The introduction of an effective dementia therapy would likely require important changes in the delivery of dementia care. We propose that dementia DMTs approval should incorporate consideration of the ramifications beyond the issue of drug efficacy. At present, patients receiving any Alzheimer disease monoclonal antibody therapy require an Alzheimer disease diagnosis validation by amyloid PET or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer disease biomarker testing12 — neither of which are available on universal health care in Australia and New Zealand. The socio-economic implications of any potential approved therapy are a major consideration.13 We note that prior health economic analyses for aducanumab had negligible clinical benefit or improvement in health outcomes at considerable cost,14 which may be different for lecanemab.5 Supportive care is the current gold standard of dementia medical treatment, including symptomatic treatments and non-pharmacological therapies. It is fortunate that a multidisciplinary team model is accepted practice in dementia care,15 but dementia care delivery models will require significant modification. Physicians will need upskilling in the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive disorders. Neurologists, geriatricians, and psychiatrists are well poised for this upskilling, working with general practitioners, neuropsychologists, and other health clinicians. A large sector of dementia clinicians will require structured education in molecular diagnostics. Patients will need rapid access to cognitive clinicians, neuropsychologists, neuroradiologists, advanced neuroimaging, and CSF and blood biomarker capabilities. Early diagnosis of specific dementia subtypes is finally on the horizon.16, 17 Clinical phenotypes do not always match underlying molecular pathology in dementias,18 and obtaining a molecular diagnosis has been shown to definitively change management.19 Blood biomarkers look to be available in the next five years. Furthermore, abnormal biomarkers alone raise significant management issues, including treatment of asymptomatic patients (amyloid not causing cognitive decline) and of patients excluded from trials (eg, those with multiple microhaemorrhages). Moreover, the optimal duration of treatment is not currently known. Guidelines for the detection and diagnosis of ARIA have been developed12 but will need honing and updating. Reporting will be needed by a radiology workforce skilled in the diagnosis of ARIA and managed by clinicians skilled in the care of people with brain oedema and haemorrhage. New Medicare codes may need to be generated for the purposes of these treatments. Precision medicine to determine disease risk and therapy response is likely to expand. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes are already known to have an impact on the safety and response to some anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody treatments.7 APOE Ɛ4 carriers are more likely to have ARIA and to have faster Alzheimer disease progression than other APOE allele carriers, potentially affecting response and risk. APOE allele tests are not reimbursed in Australia and New Zealand, with some patients also concerned about the consequences of genetic testing for health or life insurance.20 Genetic counselling before testing may be required in some states and territories. Most current Alzheimer disease therapies in late phase 3 development require two to four weekly intravenous infusions.2, 4 Multiple sclerosis, another common neurological disease, could serve as a model for rapid implementation. The treatment of multiple sclerosis in the past two decades has transformed care and prognosis, requiring considerable restructure to health care provision. Conservative estimates of demand for an intravenous Alzheimer disease treatment would represent a fivefold increase in patients compared with multiple sclerosis. Infusion therapies are now part of the armamentarium for the treatment of many other chronic diseases but increased ancillary staffing will be needed to manage the complexities of scheduling the biweekly infusions, the scans, and the complications arising. In Australia and New Zealand, dementia is largely treated in the primary care sector and diagnosed in multidisciplinary memory clinics. Victoria has a network of geriatrician-staffed Cognitive, Dementia and Memory Services. Specialist public cognitive neurology services are rare and, historically, the diagnosis of dementia has relied heavily on the private rooms of physicians and psychiatrists. Only 15% of Australian patients receive a diagnosis of dementia in a memory clinic, with most patients diagnosed in hospital settings.21 There have been informal cognitive neurology Fellowships in Australia for more than ten years, but the first position accredited by the Australian and New Zealand Association of Neurologists was approved in 2015. This has been oversubscribed since then, with a waiting list of three years and requests from multiple subspecialty advanced trainees suggesting there is great demand for this expertise. We are sensitive to the lack of an approved DMT for Australasian patients with Alzheimer disease, and to the fact that dementia advocacy groups have applauded the accelerated FDA approval of aducanumab and lecanemab in the United States. These are the first of many new dementia pathology-specific DMTs. Other Alzheimer disease DMTs are in phase 3 trials, with results of further phase 3 trials expected at the end of 2023 (eg, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04437511, NCT04388254, and NCT04592874). Therapeutic advancement is well underway, and the medical community needs to keep pace.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for more than 40% of dementias in the elderly. The clinical manifestation of AD may be subtle, and early diagnosis is difficult but crucial, to enable early drug intervention and improved prognosis. In order to early diagnose AD, we applied MR volumetry techniques for the hippocampus and cerebrum in an attempt to detect the early changes of AD. From an eligible population of 103 AD patients, 11 with early AD were identified and had MRI performed. 12 normal age-matched controls were also recruited. All AD patients evaluation was based on the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. We compared cerebral and hippocampal volumes of the two groups: normal and AD patients, and found statistically significant difference of total brain volume and hippocampal volume between the two groups. This suggests that, though technically challenging and manually cum time intensive, MR volumetry in the early AD patients is useful and facilitates the detection of the early changes of hippocampal atrophy.",3,,1523,1526,Hippocampal formation; Pediatrics; Disease; Dementia; Hippocampus; Population; Clinical manifestation; Cerebrum; Brain size; Medicine,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1202875 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/8534/27062/01202875.pdf,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/8534/27062/01202875.pdf,,,1569039002,,0,002-307-472-988-213; 009-430-635-976-777; 012-468-447-103-719; 019-947-728-992-041; 020-798-450-711-581; 026-639-308-701-681; 037-123-444-159-294; 048-974-046-021-753; 071-444-579-638-671; 081-173-779-958-814; 095-332-731-948-784; 103-511-158-017-718; 113-452-070-312-937; 115-825-804-587-190; 135-212-148-446-130,6,false,,

These studies, however, did not use biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) to either confirm the diagnosis or assess the relative prevalence of AD pathology when investigating the risk of dementia in PTSD. ; Aim; This study aimed at testing the hypothesis that Vietnam veterans with combat PTSD have an increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease in comparison with veteran controls as measured by biomarkers such as amyloid-beta and tau retention in the brain and regional hypometabolism and atrophy. ; Method; Vietnam veterans with a history of PTSD as defined by the Clinicians-Administered PTSD scale (CAPS) score of 40 or above and veteran control subjects as defined by CAPS score of 30 or below and with no current clinical evidence of dementia participated in the study. Outcome measurements were amyloid-beta and tau deposition and regional brain metabolism and volumetry. Amyloid-beta and tau burden was estimated by the Specific Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) of 18F-florbetaben, and 18F-AV-1451 respectively. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic (PET) scan measured regional brain metabolism, and 3-Tesla T1 MP-RAGE Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) estimated regional volumetry. Comprehensive neuropsychological battery measured cognitive function. ; Results; Between March 2014 and June 2017, 83 male Vietnam Veterans (controls, n=30, CAPS=4; lifetime PTSD, n=53, CAPS=73.95; lifetime and current PTSD, n=30, CPAS=52.50) completed the assessments. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the uptake of 18F-florbetaben, 18F-AV-1451 or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, or regional brain volumetry. The rate of apolipoprotein E e4 allele was not significantly different between the groups. Compared with control veterans, the PTSD participants had a significantly lower level of education, predicted premorbid Intelligent Quotient (IQ), and total intracranial volume and higher depression rating score. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was significantly lower in the PTSD group than in controls. The group differences in Montreal Cognitive Assessment did not remain, however, when adjusted for premorbid IQ or depression in a multilinear regression model analysis. ; Conclusions; Posttraumatic stress disorder is not associated with an increased prevalence of biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease. The proxy measures of cognitive reserve, a factor that may delay the onset of Alzheimer’s dementia, were relatively low in subjects with PTSD, and this may explain the previously reported higher incidence of dementia in subjects with PTSD compared to age-matched controls.",,,,,Epidemiology; Cognition; Montreal Cognitive Assessment; Traumatic stress; Disease; Dementia; Atrophy; Cognitive reserve; Clinical psychology; Medicine,,,,,https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/254307 https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1484518-the-australian-imaging--biomarkers-and-lifestyle-study-of-ageing-(aibl)-veterans-study---post-traumatic-stress-disorder-and-risk-of-alzheimer's-disease https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/handle/11343/254307/c7de55cb-e0e3-e711-947a-0050568d0279_PhD_688403_AE_Revision_Submission.pdf,https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/254307,,,3110806344,,0,,0,false,,
