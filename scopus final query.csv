However, cognitive symptoms of TES overlap with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and features of AD pathology like beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques often co-occur with CTE, making clinical-to-pathological conclusions of TES diagnoses challenging. We investigated how Alzheimer’s neuropathological changes associated with cognition, brain volume, and plasma biomarkers in patients with repetitive head impacts (RHI)/TES, clinical AD, or typically aging controls. Methods: We studied 154 participants including 33 with RHI/TES (age 61.5 ± 11.5, 100% male, 11/33 Aβ[+]), 62 with AD and no known prior RHI (age 67.1 ± 10.2, 48% male, 62/62 Aβ[+]), and 59 healthy controls without RHI (HC; age 73.0 ± 6.2, 40% male, 0/59 Aβ[+]). Patients completed neuropsychological testing (memory, executive functioning, language, visuospatial) and structural MRI (voxel-based morphometry analysis), and provided plasma samples analyzed for GFAP, NfL, IL-6, IFN-γ, and YKL-40. For cognition and plasma biomarkers, patients with RHI/TES were stratified as Aβ[+] or Aβ[−] and compared to each other plus the AD and HC groups (ANCOVA adjusting for age and sex). Differences with at least a medium effect size (Cohen’s d > 0.50) were interpreted as potentially meaningful. Results: Cognitively, within the TES group, Aβ[+] RHI/TES performed worse than Aβ[-] RHI/TES on visuospatial (p =.04, d = 0.86) and memory testing (p =.07, d = 0.74). Comparing voxel-wise brain volume, both Aβ[+] and Aβ[−] RHI/TES had lower medial and anterior temporal lobe volume than HC and did not significantly differ from AD. Comparing plasma biomarkers, Aβ[+] RHI/TES had higher plasma GFAP than HC (p =.01, d = 0.88) and did not significantly differ from AD. Conversely, Aβ[−] RHI/TES had higher NfL than HC (p =.004, d = 0.93) and higher IL-6 than all other groups (p’s ≤.004, d’s > 1.0). Conclusions: Presence of Alzheimer’s pathology in patients with RHI/TES is associated with altered cognitive and biomarker profiles. Patients with RHI/TES and positive Aβ-PET have cognitive and plasma biomarker changes that are more like patients with AD than patients with Aβ[−] RHI/TES. Measuring well-validated Alzheimer’s biomarkers in patients with RHI/TES could improve interpretation of research findings and heighten precision in clinical management. © 2023, The Author(s).","Amyloid; Biomarker; Brain injury; Chronic traumatic encephalopathy; GFAP; NfL; PET; Plasma; Repetitive head impacts; Traumatic encephalopathy syndrome","Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Brain; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy; Cognition; Female; Humans; Interleukin-6; Male; amyloid beta protein; biological marker; gamma interferon; glial fibrillary acidic protein; interleukin 6; neurofilament protein; biological marker; interleukin 6; adult; Alzheimer disease; Article; blood sampling; brain disease; brain size; clinical feature; cognition; controlled study; disease association; executive function; female; human; language ability; major clinical study; male; memory; middle aged; neuroimaging; neuropsychological assessment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; risk factor; traumatic encephalopathy syndrome; brain; chronic traumatic encephalopathy; cognition; complication; diagnostic imaging; traumatic brain injury","B.M.

Design, Setting, and Participants: A multisite, naturalistic, longitudinal cohort study (10 sites in 5 European countries; including major follow-up intervals at 9 and 18 months) with a referred patient sample of those with clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P), recent-onset psychosis (ROP), recent-onset depression (ROD), and healthy controls were recruited between February 1, 2014, to July 1, 2019. Data were analyzed between January 2020 and January 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: A nonnegative matrix factorization technique separately decomposed clinical (287 variables) and parcellated brain structural volume (204 gray, white, and cerebrospinal fluid regions) data across CHR-P, ROP, ROD, and healthy controls study groups. Stability criteria determined cluster number using nested cross-validation. Validation targets were compared across subgroup solutions (premorbid, longitudinal, and schizophrenia polygenic risk scores). Multiclass supervised machine learning produced a transferable solution to the validation sample. Results: There were a total of 749 individuals in the discovery group and 610 individuals in the validation group. Individuals included those with CHR-P (n = 287), ROP (n = 323), ROD (n = 285), and healthy controls (n = 464), The mean (SD) age was 25.1 (5.9) years, and 702 (51.7%) were female. A clinical 4-dimensional solution separated individuals based on positive symptoms, negative symptoms, depression, and functioning, demonstrating associations with all validation targets. Brain clustering revealed a subgroup with distributed brain volume reductions associated with negative symptoms, reduced performance IQ, and increased schizophrenia polygenic risk scores. Multilevel results distinguished between normative and illness-related brain differences. Subgroup results were largely validated in the external sample. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this longitudinal cohort study provide stratifications beyond the expression of positive symptoms that cut across illness stages and diagnoses. Clinical results suggest the importance of negative symptoms, depression, and functioning. Brain results suggest substantial overlap across illness stages and normative variation, which may highlight a vulnerability signature independent from specific presentations. Premorbid, longitudinal, and genetic risk validation suggested clinical importance of the subgroups to preventive treatments.. © 2022 American Medical Association.

Approval of the antibody donanemab is awaiting further data. However, published trial data indicate few, small and uncertain clinical benefits, below what is considered “clinically meaningful” and similar to the effect of conventional medication. Furthermore, a therapy-related decrease in the amyloid-PET signal may also reflect increased cell damage rather than simply “amyloid removal”. This interpretation is more consistent with increased rates of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities and brain volume loss in treated patients, relative to placebo. We also challenge the current diagnostic criteria for AD based on amyloid-PET imaging biomarkers and recommend that future anti-AD therapy trials apply: (1) diagnosis of AD based on the co-occurrence of cognitive decline and decreased cerebral metabolism assessed by FDA-approved FDG-PET, (2) therapy efficacy determined by favorable effect on cognitive ability, cerebral metabolism by FDG-PET, and brain volumes by MRI, and (3) neuropathologic examination of all deaths occurring in these trials. © 2023 by the authors.","Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid; amyloid-PET; ARIA; Aβ; FDG-PET; MRI","aducanumab; amyloid beta protein; biological marker; donanemab; fluorodeoxyglucose; lecanemab; placebo; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain metabolism; brain size; clinical assessment; clinical dementia rating scale; clinical effectiveness; cognition; cognitive defect; computer assisted tomography; gray matter; human; memory disorder; minimal clinically important difference; national health organization; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; positron emission tomography","P.F.

Hence, we aimed to investigate the inter-method agreement and reliability of three clinically available brain volumetric software packages: FreeSurfer (FS), NeuroQuant® (NQ), and Heuron AD (HAD). Materials and Methods: In this study, we retrospectively included 78 patients who underwent conventional three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighed imaging (T1WI) to evaluate their memory impairment, including 21 with normal objective cognitive function, 24 with mild cognitive impairment, and 33 with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). All 3D T1WI scans were analyzed using three different volumetric software packages. Repeated-measures analysis of variance, intraclass correlation coefficient, effect size measurements, and Bland–Altman analysis were used to evaluate the inter-method agreement and reliability. Results: The measured volumes demonstrated substantial to almost perfect agreement for most brain regions bilaterally, except for the bilateral globi pallidi. However, the volumes measured using the three software packages showed significant mean differences for most brain regions, with consistent systematic biases and wide limits of agreement in the Bland–Altman analyses. The pallidum showed the largest effect size in the comparisons between NQ and FS (5.20–6.93) and between NQ and HAD (2.01–6.17), while the cortical gray matter showed the largest effect size in the comparisons between FS and HAD (0.79–1.91). These differences and variations between the software packages were also observed in the subset analyses of 45 patients without AD and 33 patients with AD. Conclusions: Despite their favorable reliability, the software-based brain volume measurements showed significant differences and systematic biases in most regions. Thus, these volumetric measurements should be interpreted based on the type of volumetric software used, particularly for smaller structures. Moreover, users should consider the replaceability-related limitations when using these packages in real-world practice. © 2024 by the authors.","brain volumetry; Freesurfer; Heuron AD; memory deficits; NeuroQuant; reliability","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Software; aged; Alzheimer disease; brain; cognitive defect; comparative study; diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; female; human; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; retrospective study; software; very elderly","H.J.

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has been widely used in research and clinical care for diagnosis and monitoring AD progression. However, atrophy patterns are complex and vary by patient. To address this issue, researchers have made efforts to develop more concise metrics that can summarize AD-specific atrophy. Many of these methods can be difficult to interpret clinically, hampering adoption. In this study, we introduce a novel index which we call an “AD-NeuroScore,” that uses a modified Euclidean-inspired distance function to calculate differences between regional brain volumes associated with cognitive decline. The index is adjusted for intracranial volume (ICV), age, sex, and scanner model. We validated AD-NeuroScore using 929 older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, with a mean age of 72.7 years (SD = 6.3; 55.1–91.5) and cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD diagnoses. Our validation results showed that AD-NeuroScore was significantly associated with diagnosis and disease severity scores (measured by MMSE, CDR-SB, and ADAS-11) at baseline. Furthermore, baseline AD-NeuroScore was associated with both changes in diagnosis and disease severity scores at all time points with available data. The performance of AD-NeuroScore was equivalent or superior to adjusted hippocampal volume (AHV), a widely used metric in AD research. Further, AD-NeuroScore typically performed as well as or sometimes better when compared to other existing sMRI-based metrics. In conclusion, we have introduced a new metric, AD-NeuroScore, which shows promising results in detecting AD, benchmarking disease severity, and predicting disease progression. AD-NeuroScore differentiates itself from other metrics by being clinically practical and interpretable. © 2023 The Authors","Alzheimer's disease; Biomarker; Dementia; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mild cognitive impairment","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Progression; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Temporal Lobe; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain atrophy; brain function; brain region; brain size; clinical dementia rating scale; comparative study; controlled study; demographics; disease exacerbation; disease severity; disease severity assessment; electronic health record; female; follow up; good clinical practice; human; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; nerve degeneration; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Alzheimer disease; atrophy; cognitive defect; degenerative disease; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; temporal lobe","J.E.

Though they have shown great performance on accuracy, some of them provide decisions that are hard to explain while others encode information from irrelevant or noisy regions. In this work, we try to close this gap by proposing an explainable framework which consists of a predictor and an explainable tool, so as to provide accurate diagnoses with intuitive visualization maps and prediction basis. Specifically, the predictor is designed by applying attention mechanisms to multi-scale features so as to learn and discover class discriminative latent representations that are close to each brain volume's label. Meanwhile, to explain our predictor, we propose the novel explainable tool which includes a high-resolution visualization method and a prediction-basis creation and retrieval module. The former effectively integrates the feature maps of intermediate layers as well as the last convolutional layer, which surpasses state-of-the-art visualization approaches in producing high-resolution representations with more accurate localization of discriminative areas. While the latter provides prediction basis evidence via retrieved volumes with similar latent representations which are accessible to neurologists. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework achieves higher level of accuracy and explainability over other state-of-the-art solutions. More importantly, it localizes crucial brain areas with clearer boundaries, less noises, which matches background knowledge in the neuroscience literature. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Explainable neural networks; High-resolution heatmap; MRI; XAI","Computer aided diagnosis; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Medical imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Visualization; Alzheimers disease; Disease diagnosis; Explainable neural network; Heatmaps; High resolution; High-resolution heatmap; Neural-networks; State of the art; Visual classification; XAI; Forecasting","W.

A brain morphological signature of schizophrenia was reported in a recent study and is defined by clusters of brain regions with reduced volume in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy individuals. This signature was proven to be effective at differentiating patients with schizophrenia from healthy individuals, suggesting that it is a good candidate brain biomarker of schizophrenia. However, the longitudinal characteristics of this signature have remained unclear. In this study, we examined whether these changes occurred over time and whether they were associated with clinical outcomes. We found a significant change in the brain morphological signature in schizophrenia patients with more brain volume loss than the natural, age-related reduction in healthy individuals, suggesting that this change can capture a progressive morphological change in the brain. We further found a significant association between changes in the brain morphological signature and changes in the full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ). The patients with IQ improvement showed preserved brain morphological signatures, whereas the patients without IQ improvement showed progressive changes in the brain morphological signature, suggesting a link between potential recovery of intellectual abilities and the speed of brain pathology progression. We conclude that the brain morphological signature is a brain biomarker that can be used to evaluate progressive changes in the brain that are associated with cognitive impairment due to schizophrenia. © 2024 The Authors.

In addition, we related sHHV to cross-sectional differences in plasma biomarkers of AD (β-amyloid [Aβ]42/40), astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and neurodegeneration (neurofilament light [NfL]). Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants were recruited from the community and assessed with serial brain MRIs and cognitive examinations over an average of 3.4 (SD = 3.2) and 8.6 (SD = 7.7) years, respectively. sHHV classification used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes documented at comprehensive health and functional screening evaluations at each study visit. Linear mixed-effects and multivariable linear regression models were used in analyses.ResultsA total of 1,009 participants were included in the primary MRI analysis, 98% of whom were cognitively normal at baseline MRI (mean age = 65.7 years; 54.8% female). Having a sHHV diagnosis (N = 119) was associated with longitudinal reductions in white matter volume (annual additional rate of change -0.34 cm3/y; p = 0.035), particularly in the temporal lobe. However, there was no association between sHHV and changes in total brain, total gray matter, or AD signature region volumes. Among the 119 participants with sHHV, exposure to antiviral treatment attenuated declines in occipital white matter (p = 0.04). Although the sHHV group had higher cognitive scores at baseline, sHHV diagnosis was associated with accelerated longitudinal declines in attention (annual additional rate of change -0.01 Z-score/year; p = 0.008). In addition, sHHV diagnosis was associated with elevated plasma GFAP, but not related to Aβ42/40 and NfL levels.DiscussionThese findings suggest an association of sHHV infection with white matter volume loss, attentional decline, and astrogliosis. Although the findings link sHHV to several neurocognitive features, the results do not support an association between sHHV and AD-specific disease processes.  © American Academy of Neurology.","","Aged; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Baltimore; Biomarkers; Brain; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Gliosis; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Viruses; 5 (2 bromovinyl) 2' deoxyuridine; aciclovir; amyloid beta protein[1-40]; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; biological marker; cidofovir; famciclovir; ganciclovir; glial fibrillary acidic protein; idoxuridine; neurofilament light protein; neurofilament protein; penciclovir; tromantadine; unclassified drug; valaciclovir; valganciclovir; biological marker; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; astrocytosis; attention; brain size; cognition; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; gray matter; herpes virus infection; Herpesviridae; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; nerve degeneration; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occipital lobe; protein blood level; risk factor; symptomatic human herpes virus infection; symptomatic human herpes virus infection; temporal lobe; very elderly; white matter; aging; Alzheimer disease; brain; cognition; cognitive defect; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; gliosis; Maryland; psychology; virus","K.A.

This study examines whether social network attributes moderate the association between amygdalar volume and cognitive function. Methods: Data were from the Social Networks in Alzheimer Disease study (N = 154) and Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Social networks were measured using the PhenX Social Network Battery. Regional data from magnetic resonance imaging (amygdalar volume [AV]) were analyzed using FreeSurfer software. Cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and consensus diagnosis. Linear regression analyses were conducted to test the moderating role of social networks on the association between AV and cognitive function. Results: Participants with greater ability to span multiple social roles and subgroups within their networks scored higher on the MoCA after adjusting for sociodemographic variables, depression, frequency of contact, and AV. Social networks moderated the association between AV and cognitive function. Discussion: Among participants who engaged in diverse and loosely connected social networks, the expected adverse cognitive effects of brain volume in regions implicated in socioemotional processing were attenuated. These findings suggest that cognitive stimulation achieved through social interaction with a diverse array of social relationships across multiple contexts may help promote cognitive reserve.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) accounts for approximately 60–80% of all dementia cases in older adults. This study aimed to examine the relationship between finger movements and brain volume in AD patients using a voxel-based reginal analysis system for Alzheimer’s disease (VSRAD) software. Methods Patients diagnosed with AD at the Center for Comprehensive Care and Research on Memory Disorders were included. The diagnostic criteria were based on the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association. A finger-tapping device was used for all measurements. Participants performed the tasks in the following order: with their non-dominant hand, dominant hand, both hands simultaneously, and alternate hands. Movements were measured for 15 s each. The relationship between distance and output was measured. Magnetic resonance imaging measurements were performed, and VSRAD was conducted using sagittal section 3D T1-weighted images. The Z-score was used to calculate the severity of medial temporal lobe atrophy. Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient analyzed the relationship between the severity of medial temporal lobe atrophy and mean values of the parameters in the finger-tapping movements. The statistical significance level was set at <5%. The calculated p-values were corrected using the Bonferroni method. Results Sixty-two patients were included in the study. Comparison between VSRAD and MoCA-J scores corrected for p-values showed a significant negative correlation with the extent of gray matter atrophy (r = -0. 52; p< 0.001). A positive correlation was observed between the severity of medial temporal lobe atrophy and standard deviation (SD) of the distance rate of velocity peak in extending movements in the non-dominant hand (r = 0. 51; p< 0.001). Conclusions The SD of distance rate of velocity peak in extending movements extracted from finger taps may be a useful parameter for the early detection of AD and diagnosis of its severity. © 2022 Sugioka et al.

Among many clinical use cases, brain age could be a novel outcome measure to assess the preventive effect of life-style interventions. Methods: The REMEMBER study population (N = 742) consisted of cognitively healthy (HC,N = 91), subjective cognitive decline (SCD,N = 65), mild cognitive impairment (MCI,N = 319) and AD dementia (ADD,N = 267) subjects. Automated brain volumetry of global, cortical, and subcortical brain structures computed by the CE-labeled and FDA-cleared software icobrain dm (dementia) was retrospectively extracted from T1-weighted MRI sequences that were acquired during clinical routine at participating memory clinics from the Belgian Dementia Council. The volumetric features, along with sex, were combined into a weighted sum using a linear model, and were used to predict ‘brain age’ and ‘brain predicted age difference’ (BPAD = brain age–chronological age) for every subject. Results: MCI and ADD patients showed an increased brain age compared to their chronological age. Overall, brain age outperformed BPAD and chronological age in terms of classification accuracy across the AD spectrum. There was a weak-to-moderate correlation between total MMSE score and both brain age (r = -0.38,p <.001) and BPAD (r = -0.26,p <.001). Noticeable trends, but no significant correlations, were found between BPAD and incidence of conversion from MCI to ADD, nor between BPAD and conversion time from MCI to ADD. BPAD was increased in heavy alcohol drinkers compared to non-/sporadic (p =.014) and moderate (p =.040) drinkers. Conclusions: Brain age and associated BPAD have the potential to serve as indicators for, and to evaluate the impact of lifestyle modifications or interventions on, brain health. © The Author(s) 2024.","Alzheimer’s disease; Automated volumetry; Biomarker; Brain age; Brain predicted age difference; Magnetic resonance imaging","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Healthy Aging; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; biological marker; biological marker; age; aged; aging; Alzheimer disease; Article; Belgium; brain age; brain lateral ventricle; brain predicted age difference; brain size; classification; cognition; cognitive defect; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; data extraction; demographics; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease course; disease exacerbation; evaluation research; female; frontal lobe; gray matter; healthy aging; heavy drinker; human; image segmentation; left hippocampus; lifestyle modification; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mathematical variable; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; moderate drinker; morphology; nonsporadic drinker; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occipital lobe; outcome assessment; parietal lobe; pathological aging; people by drinking status; predictive model; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; right hippocampus; sensitivity and specificity; sex; single interpretable variable; sporadic drinker; statistical model; statistical parameters; T1 weighted imaging; temporal lobe; thalamus; time factor; volumetry; white matter; Alzheimer disease; brain; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; physiology; procedures; very elderly","S.

Specifically, we tested for potentially increased activity in individuals with a higher AD risk due to subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We further tested whether activity differences related to diagnostic groups were accounted for by CSF markers of AD or brain atrophy. Methods We studied 499 participants aged 60-88 years from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE) who underwent task-fMRI. Participants included 163 cognitively normal (healthy control, HC) individuals, 222 SCD, 82 MCI, and 32 patients with clinical diagnosis of mild AD. CSF levels of β-amyloid 42/40 ratio and phosphorylated-tau181 were available from 232 participants. We used region-based analyses to assess novelty-related activity (novel > highly familiar scenes) in entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and precuneus as well as whole-brain voxel-wise analyses. First, general linear models tested differences in fMRI activity between participant groups. Complementary regression models tested quadratic relationships between memory impairment and activity. Second, relationships of activity with AD CSF biomarkers and brain volume were analyzed. Analyses were controlled for age, sex, study site, and education. Results In the precuneus, we observed an inverted U-shaped pattern of novelty-related activity across groups, with higher activity in SCD and MCI compared with HC, but not in patients with AD who showed relatively lower activity than MCI. This nonlinear pattern was confirmed by a quadratic relationship between memory impairment and precuneus activity. Precuneus activity was not related to AD biomarkers or brain volume. In contrast to the precuneus, hippocampal activity was reduced in AD dementia compared with all other groups and related to AD biomarkers. Discussion Novelty-related activity in the precuneus follows a nonlinear pattern across the clinical spectrum of increased AD risk. Although the underlying mechanism remains unclear, increased precuneus activity might represent an early signature of memory impairment. Our results highlight the nonlinearity of activity alterations that should be considered in clinical trials using functional outcome measures or targeting hyperactivity. © American Academy of Neurology.","","Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Parietal Lobe; Temporal Lobe; amyloid beta protein; biological marker; Alzheimer disease; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parietal lobe; procedures; temporal lobe","A.

This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of QMTA and its related components (inferior lateral ventricle [ILV] and hippocampus) with MTA in the early diagnosis of MCI and AD. Methods: This study included four groups: normal (NC), MCI stable (MCIs), MCI converted to AD (MCIs), and mild AD (M-AD) groups. Magnetic resonance image analysis software was used to quantify the hippocampus, ILV, and QMTA. MTA was rated by two experienced neurologists. Receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed to compare their capability in differentiating AD from NC and MCI, and optimal thresholds were determined using the Youden index. Results: QMTA distinguished M-AD from NC and MCI with higher diagnostic accuracy than MTA, hippocampus, and ILV (AUCNC = 0.976, AUCMCI = 0.836, AUCMCIs = 0.894, AUCMCIc = 0.730). The diagnostic accuracy of QMTA was superior to that of MTA, the hippocampus, and ILV in differentiating MCI from AD. The diagnostic accuracy of QMTA was found to remain the best across age, sex, and pathological subgroups analyzed. The sensitivity (92.45%) and specificity (90.64%) were higher in this study when a cutoff value of 0.635 was chosen for QMTA. Conclusions: QMTA may be a better choice than the MTA scale or the associated quantitative components alone in identifying AD patients and MCI individuals with higher progression risk. © 2023 The Authors.

Early and accurate diagnosis of the disease is very crucial. Currently, over 55 million people suffer from Alzheimer's, with 10 million new cases every year. Early detection of the disease can prevent the damage of brain tissues, though there is no specific treatment for it. The study focuses on developing machine learning models to analyze Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scans, which is a safe imagining technique. Structural MRI measures brain volumes and stages like Mild Demented, Very Mild Demented, Non-Demented and Moderate Demented. Machine Learning helps computer detect Alzheimer's in MRI scans using a large dataset. In today's world Deep Learning techniques have successfully brought change in numerous fields including medical image analysis. Prevention focuses on early detection, lifestyle factors like diet and exercise, cognitive stimulation, and managing risk factors like hypertension and diabetes. While there is no cure for Alzheimer's these measures can help delay the onset, improve quality of life for the affected and progression of the disease. The model tries to obtain efficiency and accuracy for early-stage Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.  © 2024 IEEE.","component: Alzheimer's disease; Deep Learning; Detection; Magnetic Resonsnce Imaging","Brain mapping; Contrastive Learning; Damage detection; Deep learning; Disease control; Electroencephalography; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurophysiology; Risk assessment; Alzheimer; Alzheimers disease; Brain tissue; Component: alzheimer disease; Deep learning; Detection; Machine learning models; Magnetic resonsnce imaging; Neurological disorders; New case; Magnetic resonance imaging","B.S.

However, few studies have assessed the relationship between CP volume (CPV) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this large elderly population study, we investigated the changes in CPV in patients with MCI using MRI above 65 years. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 2144 participants (median age, 69 years; 60.9% females) who underwent 3T MRI; they were grouped as 218 MCI participants and 1904 cognitively healthy controls. The total intracranial volume (ICV), total brain volume (TBV), CPV, hippocampal volume (HV), and lateral ventricle volume (LVV) were calculated. Results: CPV/ICV was a significant independent predictor of MCI (p < 0.01) after adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and education level). The CPV/ICV ratio was also a significant independent predictor of MCI after adjusting for the TBV/ICV ratio (p = 0.022) or HV/ICV ratio (p = 0.017), in addition to potential confounders. The CPV was significantly correlated with the LVV (r = 0.97, p < 0.01). Conclusion: We identified a relationship between CPV and MCI, which could not be explained by the degree of brain atrophy. Our results support CP dysfunction in MCI. Clinical relevance statement: Choroid plexus volume measurement may serve as a valuable imaging biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring mild cognitive impairment. The enlargement of the choroid plexus, independent of brain atrophy, suggests its potential role in mild cognitive impairment pathology. Key Points: • The study examines choroid plexus volume in relation to cognitive decline in elderly. • Enlarged choroid plexus volume independently indicates mild cognitive impairment presence. • Choroid plexus volume could be a specific biomarker for early mild cognitive impairment diagnosis. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Society of Radiology 2024.","Choroid plexus; Hippocampal volume; Mild cognitive impairment","Aged; Choroid Plexus; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Organ Size; aged; Article; artifact; brain atrophy; brain lateral ventricle; brain size; choroid plexus; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; educational status; female; gray matter; hippocampus; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; image processing; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; white matter; diagnostic imaging; organ size; pathology; procedures","K.

Purpose: To compare automated methods and the gold standard manual segmentation in measuring regional brain volumes on MRI across healthy controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and patients with dementia due to AD. Study Type: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched through October 2021. Field Strength: 1.0 T, 1.5 T, or 3.0 T. Assessment: Two review authors independently identified studies for inclusion and extracted data. Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2). Statistical Tests: Standardized mean differences (SMD; Hedges' g) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis with robust variance estimation. Subgroup analyses were undertaken to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the impact of the within-study correlation between effect estimates on the meta-analysis results. Results: Seventeen studies provided sufficient data to evaluate the hippocampus, lateral ventricles, and parahippocampal gyrus. The pooled SMD for the hippocampus, lateral ventricles, and parahippocampal gyrus were 0.22 (95% CI −0.50 to 0.93), 0.12 (95% CI −0.13 to 0.37), and −0.48 (95% CI −1.37 to 0.41), respectively. For the hippocampal data, subgroup analyses suggested that the pooled SMD was invariant across clinical diagnosis and field strength. Subgroup analyses could not be conducted on the lateral ventricles data and the parahippocampal gyrus data due to insufficient data. The results were robust to the selected within-study correlation value. Data Conclusion: While automated methods are generally comparable to manual segmentation for measuring hippocampal, lateral ventricle, and parahippocampal gyrus volumes, wide 95% CIs and large heterogeneity suggest that there is substantial uncontrolled variance. Thus, automated methods may be used to measure these regions in patients with AD but should be used with caution. Evidence Level: 3.

Objectives: To study the differential evolution of both conditions including plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers. Methods: SPORTAX is a prospective registry of sporadic ataxia patients with an onset >40 years. Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia was the primary outcome measure. In subgroups, blood samples were taken and MRIs performed. Plasma NfL was measured via a single molecule assay. Regional brain volumes were automatically measured. To assess signal changes, we defined the pons and middle cerebellar peduncle abnormality score (PMAS). Using mixed-effects models, we analyzed changes on a time scale starting with ataxia onset. Results: Of 404 patients without genetic diagnosis, 130 met criteria of probable MSA-C at baseline and 26 during follow-up suggesting clinical conversion to MSA-C. The remaining 248 were classified as SAOA. At baseline, NfL, cerebellar white matter (CWM) and pons volume, and PMAS separated MSA-C from SAOA. NfL decreased in MSA-C and did not change in SAOA. CWM and pons volume decreased faster, whereas PMAS increased faster in MSA-C. In MSA-C, pons volume had highest sensitivity to change, and PMAS was a predictor of faster progression. Fulfillment of possible MSA criteria, NfL and PMAS were risk factors, CWM and pons volume protective factors for conversion to MSA-C. Conclusions: This study provides detailed information on differential evolution and prognostic relevance of biomarkers in MSA-C and SAOA. © 2023 The Authors.

Herein, the impact of genetic variations and gene-gene interactions of Th17 pathway-related genes on the risk, psychopathology, and brain volume was examined in schizophrenia patients. Methods Functional polymorphisms within interleukin 6 (IL6)(rs1800795 and rs1800797), IL10 (rs1800872 and rs1800896), IL17A (rs2275913 and rs8193036), IL22 (rs2227484 and rs2227485), IL23R (rs1884444), and IL27 (rs153109 and rs181206) genes were studied in 224 schizophrenia patients and 226 healthy controls. These variants were correlated with the brain morphometry, analyzed using MRI in a subset of patients (n = 117) and controls (n = 137). Results Patients carrying CC genotype of rs2227484 of IL22 gene had significantly higher apathy total score [F (1,183) = 5.60; P = 0.019; partial 2= 0.030]. Significant epistatic interactions between IL6 (rs1800797) and IL17A (rs2275913) genes were observed in schizophrenia patients. GG genotype of rs2275913 of IL17A gene was associated with reduced right middle occipital gyrus volume in schizophrenia patients (T = 4.56; P < 0.001). Conclusion Interactions between genes of Th17 pathway impact the risk for schizophrenia. The variants of Th17 pathway-related genes seem to have a determining effect on psychopathology and brain morphometric changes in schizophrenia. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Studies are carried out for prediction of neurodegenerative diseases and/or for the efficient treatment process. Although there are studies that address and classify neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Parkinson's individually with healthy control groups to accelerate the diagnosis stage, there are no studies that include two or more diseases at the same time. We aimed to make an original contribution to the literature by considering dementia and Parkinson's diseases together. In our study, where we classify dementia and Parkinson's on the differences in brain volume and brain thickness, we used the voxel-based morphometry technique for the volumetric measurement of shrinkage and the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for the estimation of the diseased/healthy state. In our study, we used data from 3082 participants, 1141 with Parkinson's disease, 1145 with dementia, and 796 with healthy controls. Datasets were obtained from NFID and PPMI. Atlases in SPM12 and CAT12 libraries in the MATLAB program were used for brain-volume measurements, cerebral cortex thickness, and area calculations. Obtained volume measurements were classified by the support vector machine algorithm and 10-fold cross-validation method was used for validation. As a result of the study, the mean accuracy rate of 93.51% and the mean AUC-ROC value of 97.59% were obtained. These findings show that although there are two diseases and a healthy group, it gives better results than some studies in the literature with dementia and control group or Parkinson's and control group. As a result, the SVM algorithm is in parallel with the studies conducted with dementia and control group or Parkinson's and control group, and it has been proven that it can be an effective method in a database containing both disease and control data. © 2023 IEEE.","dementia; Parkinson's Disease; support vector machine; voxel-based morphometry","Brain; Diagnosis; Disease control; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; MATLAB; Neurodegenerative diseases; Vectors; Volume measurement; Brain volume; Control groups; Dementia; Efficient treatment; Healthy controls; Parkinson's disease; Patients with dementia; Support vector machines algorithms; Support vectors machine; Voxel-based morphometry; Support vector machines","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","979-835030659-0","","","English","Innov.

The relationship of loneliness with subsequent dementia and the early preclinical course of Alzheimer disease and related dementia (ADRD) remains unclear. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to determine the association of loneliness with 10-year all-cause dementia risk and early cognitive and neuroanatomic imaging markers of ADRD vulnerability.MethodsThis was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the population-based Framingham Study cohorts (September 9, 1948-December 31, 2018). Eligible participants had loneliness assessed and were dementia-free at baseline. Loneliness was recorded with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, defined conservatively as feeling lonely ≥3 days in the past week. The main outcomes were incident dementia over a 10-year period, cognition, and MRI brain volumes and white matter injury.ResultsOf 2,308 participants (mean age 73 [SD 9] years, 56% women) who met eligibility in the dementia sample, 14% (329 of 2,308) developed dementia and 6% (144 of 2,308) were lonely. Lonely (versus not lonely) adults had higher 10-year dementia risk (age-, sex-, and education-adjusted hazard ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.06-2.24). Lonely participants <80 years of age without APOE ϵ4 alleles had a 3-fold greater risk (adjusted hazard ratio 3.03, 95% CI, 1.63-5.62). Among 1,875 persons without dementia who met eligibility in the cognition sample (mean age 62 [SD 9] years, 54% women), loneliness associated with poorer executive function, lower total cerebral volume, and greater white matter injury.DiscussionOver 10 years of close clinical dementia surveillance in this cohort study, loneliness was associated with increased dementia risk; this tripled in adults whose baseline risk would otherwise be relatively low on the basis of age and genetic risk, representing a majority of the US population. Loneliness was also associated with worse neurocognitive markers of ADRD vulnerability, suggesting an early pathogenic role. These findings may have important clinical and public health implications given observed loneliness trends.Classification of EvidenceThis study provides Class I evidence that loneliness increases the 10-year risk of developing dementia.  © American Academy of Neurology.","","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Loneliness; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; apolipoprotein E4; adult; age distribution; aged; allele; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain size; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; clinical outcome; controlled study; correlation analysis; dementia; disease predisposition; disease risk assessment; disorders of higher cerebral function; educational status; executive function; female; genetic risk; hazard ratio; human; loneliness; major clinical study; male; middle aged; morbidity; neuroanatomy; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; retrospective study; sex difference; very elderly; white matter injury; Alzheimer disease; cohort analysis; longitudinal study; psychology; risk factor","J.

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting and Participants: A total of 316,669 participants [mean (SD) age, 56.3 (8.1) years] without prior cardiovascular disease or dementia from the UK Biobank study at baseline survey (2006–2010) were enrolled. Methods: A modified version of the LE8 score was created (range: 0–100) and categorized into poor (0–49), intermediate (50–79), and optimal (80–100) CVH. Cox proportional hazard and multivariable linear regression models were used. Results: During a median 12.6 years of follow-up, 4238 all-cause dementia cases including 1797 Alzheimer's disease and 939 vascular dementia (VaD) occurred. Individuals with optimal CVH had 44% (95% CI, 0.48–0.64) lower incident all-cause dementia risk and 71% (95% CI, 0.22–0.38) lower VaD risk compared with those who had poor CVH. A 10-point increment in LE8 was associated with higher fluid intelligence scores (β, 0.088; 95% CI, 0.073–0.102) and numeric memory scores (β, 0.054; 95% CI, 0.043–0.065), and was also associated with lower white matter hyperintensity volume (β, −0.673; 95% CI, −0.751 to −0.596), larger total brain volume (β, 77.93; 95% CI, 62.03–93.84), and hippocampal volume (β, 0.197; 95% CI, 0.106–0.288). In addition, the association between LE8 profiles and dementia diagnosis differed by APOE genotype (all P for interaction ≤ .001), and was more evident among APOE-ε4 noncarriers. Conclusions and Implications: Individuals with a higher LE8 score experienced fewer dementia events (driven especially by incident VaD) and were associated with better neurocognitive brain health profiles. CVH optimization may be beneficial to the maintenance of brain health. © 2023 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine","Cardiovascular health; cognition; dementia; Life's Essential 8; magnetic resonance imaging","Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoproteins E; Brain; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cognition; Dementia, Vascular; Humans; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; apolipoprotein E4; apolipoprotein E; adult; aged; all cause dementia risk; Alzheimer disease; Article; biobank; brain health; brain size; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular health; cardiovascular system; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; cognition; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; follow up; genetic susceptibility; genotype; health; health promotion; hippocampus; human; incidence; intelligence; life essential 8 score; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; memory; multiinfarct dementia; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; numeric memory score; outcome assessment; prospective study; risk; white matter; white matter hyperintensity volume; Alzheimer disease; brain; cardiovascular disease; cognition; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; multiinfarct dementia; neuroimaging; risk factor","X.-B.

There is uncertainty about the role of β-amyloid (Aβ) co-pathology and its contribution to the variability in PD-MCI profile and cognitive progression. Objective: To study how presence of Aβ affects clinical and cognitive manifestations as well as regional brain volumes in PD-MCI. Methods: Twenty-five PD-MCI patients underwent simultaneous PET/3T-MRI with [18F]flutemetamol and a clinical and neuropsychological examination allowing level II diagnosis. We tested pairwise differences in motor, clinical, and cognitive features with Mann–Whitney U test. We calculated [18F]flutemetamol (FMM) standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) in striatal and cortical ROIs, and we performed a univariate linear regression analysis between the affected cognitive domains and the mean SUVR. Finally, we investigated differences in cortical and subcortical brain regional volumes with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: There were 8 Aβ+ and 17 Aβ- PD-MCI. They did not differ for age, disease duration, clinical, motor, behavioral, and global cognition scores. PD-MCI-Aβ+ showed worse performance in the overall executive domain (p = 0.037). Subcortical ROIs analysis showed significant Aβ deposition in PD-MCI-Aβ+ patients in the right caudal and rostral middle frontal cortex, in precuneus, in left paracentral and pars triangularis (p < 0.0001), and bilaterally in the putamen (p = 0.038). Cortical regions with higher amyloid load correlated with worse executive performances (p < 0.05). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses showed no between groups differences. Conclusions: Presence of cerebral Aβ worsens executive functions, but not motor and global cognitive abilities in PD-MCI, and it is not associated with middle-temporal cortex atrophy. These findings, together with the observation of significant proportion of PD-MCI-Aβ-, suggest that Aβ may not be the main pathogenetic determinant of cognitive deterioration in PD-MCI, but it would rather aggravate deficits in domains vulnerable to Parkinson primary pathology.

Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent kind of dementia affecting people aged 60 and above. It is a neurodegenerative type of dementia that starts in the middle and gets worse over time. Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, depression, and other brain illnesses can all be diagnosed using hippocampus segmentation. Medical pictures have had a significant impact on medicine, diagnosis, and treatment. One of the most crucial image processing techniques is called image segmentation. Our research focuses on measuring the volume concerning typical size by utilizing segmentation techniques. To comprehend the severity of progression in demented people, this study will look at the whole brain (WB), grey matter (GM), and hippocampal (HC) morphological variation and identify the significant biomarkers in MRI brain images. Pre-trained models can demonstrate hippocampal regions with significant severity differences for the considered classes of CN and AD. It is determined that the CNN model for the HC region produces better categorization for CN and AD with 98.2 percent accuracy each. The primary goal of the research was to identify size anomalies using several biochemical features of big medical data analysis. © 2006-2023 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

The prefrontal cortex (PFC), especially ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) which may play roles by regulating cognitive control processes. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there is abnormal functional connectivity (FC) maps and volume changes in PD with RBD(PD-RBD). We recruited 20 PD-RBD, 20 PD without RBD (PD-nRBD), and 20 normal controls (NC). We utilized resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-MRI) to explore FC changes based on regions of interest (VLPFC, DLPFC, and IFG), and used voxel-based morphology technology to analyze whole-brain volumes by 3D-T1 structural MRI. Except the REM sleep behavioral disorders questionnaire (RBDSQ), the PD-RBD showed lower visuospatial/executive and attention scores than the NC group. The RBDSQ scores were significantly positively correlated with zFC of right DLPFC to bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (P = 0.0362, R = 0.4708, AlphaSim corrected) and also significantly positively correlated with zFC of left VLPFC to right inferior temporal (P = 0.0157, R = 0.5323, AlphaSim corrected) in PD-RBD group. Furthermore, abnormal correlations with zFC values were also found in some cognitive subdomains in PD-RBD group. The study may suggest that in PD-RBD patients, the presence of RBD may be related to the abnormal FC of VLPFC and DLPFC, meanwhile, the abnormal FC of DLPFC and IFG may be related to the mechanisms of cognitive impairment. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Functional connectivity (FC); Parkinson’s disease (PD); Prefrontal cortex (PFC); Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD); Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging(rs-MRI)","Cognition; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Parkinson Disease; Prefrontal Cortex; REM Sleep Behavior Disorder; adult; Article; behavior disorder; clinical article; cognitive defect; controlled study; correlation analysis; data classification; data processing; disease duration; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; executive function; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; Hamilton Anxiety Scale; human; inferior frontal gyrus; information processing; male; medial prefrontal cortex; Mini Mental State Examination; Montreal cognitive assessment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; polysomnography; posterior cingulate; prefrontal cortex; questionnaire; REM sleep; REM sleep behavior disorder; supplementary motor area; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; cognition; diagnostic imaging; prefrontal cortex; procedures","O.

Objective: To investigate diagnostic utility of MRI volumetry in traumatic brain injury (TBI), early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD), late-onset Alzheimer disease, and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Method: We utilized 137 participants of TBI (n = 40), EOAD (n = 45), LOAD (n = 32), and bvFTD (n = 20). Participants had 3D T1 brain MRI imaging amendable to MRI volumetry. Scan volumes were analyzed with Neuroreader. One-way ANOVA compared brain volumes across diagnostic groups. Discriminant analysis was done with leave-one-out cross validation on Neuroreader metrics to determine diagnostic delineation across groups. Result: LOAD was the oldest compared to other groups (F = 27.5, p <.001). There were no statistically significant differences in sex (p =.58) with women comprising 54.7% of the entire cohort. EOAD and LOAD had the lowest Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores compared to TBI (p =.04 for EOAD and p =.01 for LOAD). LOAD had lowest hippocampal volumes (Left Hippocampus F = 13.1, Right Hippocampus F = 7.3, p <.001), low white matter volume in TBI (F = 5.9, p <.001), lower left parietal lobe volume in EOAD (F = 9.4, p <.001), and lower total gray matter volume in bvFTD (F = 32.8, p <.001) and caudate atrophy (F = 1737.5, p <.001). Areas under the curve ranged from 92.3 to 100%, sensitivity between 82.2 and 100%, specificity of 78.1-100%. TBI was the most accurately delineated diagnosis. Predictive features included caudate, frontal, parietal, temporal lobar and total white matter volumes. Conclusion: We identified the diagnostic utility of regional volumetric differences across multiple neurocognitive disorders.

Study Design: This study utilized clinical scales, magnetic resonance imaging, single-cell RNA sequencing, and optogenetics to investigate the mPFC-BLA pathway in SCZ patients. In the mouse model, 6-week-old methylazoxymethanol acetate-induced mice demonstrated significant cognitive deficits, which were addressed through stereotaxic injections of an adeno-associated viral vector to unveil the neural connection between the mPFC and BLA. Study Results: Significant disparities in brain volume and neural activity, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and BLA regions, were found between SCZ patients and healthy controls. Additionally, we observed correlations indicating that reduced volumes of the DLPFC and BLA were associated with lower cognitive function scores. Activation of the mPFC-BLA pathway notably improved cognitive performance in the SCZ model mice, with the targeting of excitatory or inhibitory neurons alone failing to replicate this effect. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling revealed gene expression differences in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the BLA of SCZ model mice. Notably, genes differentially expressed in the BLA of these model mice were also found in the blood exosomes of SCZ patients. Conclusions: Our research provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of the PFC-BLA pathway in SCZ, underscoring its significance in cognitive impairment and offering novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues. Additionally, our research highlights the potential of blood exosomal mRNAs as noninvasive biomarkers for SCZ diagnosis, underscoring the clinical feasibility and utility of this method. © The Author(s) 2024.

Methods: One-hundred-twelve subjects (mean age ± SD, 66.85 ± 13.64 years) with varying degrees of cognitive decline underwent MRI using a Philips Ingenia 3T. The MTA scale by Scheltens, rated on coronal 3D T1-weighted images, was determined by three experienced radiologists, blinded to diagnosis and sex. Automated volumetry was computed by icobrain dm (v. 5.10) for total, left, right hippocampal, and ILV volumes. The ILV/Hip ratio, defined as the percentage ratio between ILV and hippocampal volumes, was calculated and compared against a normative reference population (n = 1903). Inter-rater agreement, association, classification accuracy, and clinical interpretability on patient level were reported. Results: Visual MTA scores showed excellent inter-rater agreement. Ordinal logistic regression and correlation analyses demonstrated robust associations between automated brain segmentations and visual MTA ratings, with the ILV/Hip ratio consistently outperforming individual hippocampal and ILV volumes. Pairwise classification accuracy showed good performance without statistically significant differences between the ILV/Hip ratio and visual MTA across disease stages, indicating potential interchangeability. Comparison to the normative population and clinical interpretability assessments showed commensurability in classifying MTA “severity” between visual MTA and ILV/Hip ratio measurements. Conclusion: The ILV/Hip ratio shows the highest correlation to visual MTA, in comparison to automated individual ILV and hippocampal volumes, offering standardized measures for diagnostic support in different stages of cognitive decline. © The Author(s) 2024.","Alzheimer’s disease; Automated brain volumetry; Biomarker; Dementia; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medial temporal lobe atrophy","Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Hippocampus; Humans; Lateral Ventricles; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Temporal Lobe; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain atrophy; brain lateral ventricle; brain size; clinical article; cognitive defect; controlled study; dementia; demographics; diffusion weighted imaging; disease association; female; hippocampus; human; image analysis; image segmentation; interrater reliability; male; medial temporal lobe; memory; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; neuroimaging; normotensive hydrocephalus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; radiologist; sensitivity and specificity; susceptibility weighted imaging; Youden index; atrophy; brain lateral ventricle; hippocampus; pathology; procedures; temporal lobe","G.-J.

At early stages, clinical differentiation between CBS and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) can be challenging. Methods: Using high-resolution T1-weighted images and voxel-based morphometry (VBM), we sought to identify disease-specific patterns of brain atrophy in a small sample of CBS and IPD patients at early stages of disease. We acquired MR images of 17 patients diagnosed with CBS and compared them with MR images of 17 subjects affected by IPD. Images were preprocessed and analyzed using VBM. Results: When compared to each other, the CBS and IPD patients of our cohort showed differences in regional gray and white matter volume depending on the diagnosis, specifically in the superior longitudinal fascicle. Conclusions: In our small patients’ group, VBM was able to detect changes in regional gray and white matter volume between patients affected by CBS and patients with IPD as early as 1.5-2 years after the onset of the first motor symptoms. © 2022 American Society of Neuroimaging.","brain atrophy; Corticobasal syndrome; idiopathic Parkinson syndrome; voxel-based morphometry","Atrophy; Brain; Corticobasal Degeneration; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Parkinson Disease; Parkinsonian Disorders; adult; aged; Article; brain atrophy; brain disease; brain size; clinical article; clinical study; controlled study; corticobasal syndrome; demographics; disease duration; early diagnosis; female; gray matter volume; human; idiopathic disease; male; Parkinson disease; T1 weighted imaging; voxel based morphometry; white matter; atrophy; brain; corticobasal degeneration; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parkinsonism; pathology","S.

It is characterized by structural changes in the brain, including the shrinkage of specific regions and the development of abnormalities. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that worsens over time. Spatial analysis helps identify the affected brain regions, while temporal analysis provides insights into the disease progression and temporal patterns of change. Integrating both spatial and temporal information allows for a more accurate and detailed characterization of AD. Consequently, the development of a spatio-temporal model holds promise for early diagnosis of AD. This work proposes a spatio-temporal analysis using deep neural networks this utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data obtained from two sources: the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and the Open Access Series of Imaging Scans (OASIS). Demographic information such as Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Global Clinical Dementia Rating (GCDR), and whole brain volume are important in Alzheimer’s prediction, as they provide valuable insights into cognitive function, disease progression, and brain health, aiding in the identification and assessment of individuals at risk or in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. A spatio-temporal model called Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) was developed for the analysis of spatio-temporal features using deep neural networks. The proposed ConvLSTM-based spatio-temporal model achieves an accuracy of 98% for all types of datasets, both with and without demographic information, enabling early prediction of AD. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Alzheimer’s disease; Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; convolution neural network; Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory; Long Short-Term Memory; mild cognitive impairment; Open Access Series of Imaging Scans","Brain; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Health risks; Long short-term memory; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Population statistics; Alzheimer; Alzheimer’s disease; Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative; Cognitive impairment; Convolution neural network; Convolutional long short-term memory; Mild cognitive impairment; Open access series of imaging scan; OpenAccess; Risk assessment","J.

We quantified cortical thickness and volume using FreeSurfer 7.3.2 in 19 patients with iNPH, 28 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 30 healthy controls (HC). We noted the frequent need for manual correction of the automated segmentation in iNPH and examined the effect of correction on the results. We identified statistically significant higher proportion of volume changes associated with manual edits in individuals with iNPH compared to both HC and patients with AD. Changes in cortical thickness and volume related to manual correction were also partly correlated with the severity of radiological features of iNPH. We highlight the challenges posed by the abnormal anatomy in iNPH when conducting neuroimaging analysis and emphasise the importance of quality checking and correction in this clinical population.

It has been suggested that delusions arise as a consequence of false memories. Objective: To investigate whether delusions in AD are associated with false recognition, and whether higher rates of false recognition and the presence of delusions are associated with lower regional brain volumes in the same brain regions. Design, Setting, and Participants: Since the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) launched in 2004, it has amassed an archive of longitudinal behavioral and biomarker data. This cross-sectional study used data downloaded in 2020 from ADNI participants with an AD diagnosis at baseline or follow-up. Data analysis was performed between June 24, 2020, and September 21, 2021. Exposure: Enrollment in the ADNI. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes included false recognition, measured with the 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog 13) and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and volume of brain regions corrected for total intracranial volume. Behavioral data were compared for individuals with delusions in AD and those without using independent-samples t tests or Mann-Whitney nonparametric tests. Significant findings were further explored using binary logistic regression modeling. For neuroimaging data region of interest analyses using t tests, Poisson regression modeling or binary logistic regression modeling and further exploratory, whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analyses were carried out to explore the association between regional brain volume and false recognition or presence of delusions. Results: Of the 2248 individuals in the ADNI database, 728 met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. There were 317 (43.5%) women and 411 (56.5%) men. Their mean (SD) age was 74.8 (7.4) years. The 42 participants with delusions at baseline had higher rates of false recognition on the ADAS-Cog 13 (median score, 3; IQR, 1 to 6) compared with the 549 control participants (median score, 2; IQR, 0 to 4; U = 9398.5; P =.04). False recognition was not associated with the presence of delusions when confounding variables were included in binary logistic regression models. An ADAS-Cog 13 false recognition score was inversely associated with left hippocampal volume (odds ratio [OR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.88-0.94], P <.001), right hippocampal volume (0.94 [0.92-0.97], P <.001), left entorhinal cortex volume (0.94 [0.91-0.97], P <.001), left parahippocampal gyrus volume (0.93 [0.91-0.96], P <.001), and left fusiform gyrus volume (0.97 [0.96-0.99], P <.001). There was no overlap between locations associated with false recognition and those associated with delusions. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, false memories were not associated with the presence of delusions after accounting for confounding variables, and no indication for overlap of neural networks for false memories and delusions was observed on volumetric neuroimaging. These findings suggest that delusions in AD do not arise as a direct consequence of misremembering, lending weight to ongoing attempts to delineate specific therapeutic targets for treatment of psychosis.  © 2023 American Medical Association.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a transitional phase between healthy cognitive aging and dementia. Progressive brain volume reduction/atrophy, particularly of the hippocampus, is associated with the transition from normal to MCI, and then to AD. We aimed to develop methods to characterize the shape of hippocampus and explore its potential as an imaging marker to monitor clinical AD progression. We implemented a 3D Zernike transformation to characterize the shape changes of hippocampus in 428 older subjects with high-quality T1-weighted volumetric brain scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set (151 normal, 258 MCI, and 19 AD). Over 2 years, 15 cognitively normal subjects converted to MCI, and 42 subjects with MCI converted to AD. We found a significant correlation between hippocampal volume changes and Zernike shape metrics. Before a clinical diagnosis of AD, the shapes of the left and right hippocampi changed slowly. After AD diagnosis, both volume and shape changed rapidly but were uncorrelated to each other. During the transition from a clinical diagnosis of MCI to AD, the shape of the left and right hippocampi changed in a correlated manner but became uncorrelated after AD diagnosis. Finally, the pace of hippocampus shape change was associated with its shape and the subject's age and disease condition. In conclusion, the hippocampus shape features characterized with 3D Zernike transformation, in complement to volume measures, may serve as a novel imaging marker to monitor clinical AD progression. © 2022 The Authors.

If causal, vision would be an important modifiable risk factor with viable population-level interventions. Objective: To evaluate potentially causal associations between visual acuity, eye conditions (specifically cataracts and myopia), neuroimaging outcomes, and ADRDs. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cohort and 2-sample bidirectional mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted using UK Biobank participants and summary statistics from previously published genome-wide association studies on cataract, myopia, and AD. The participants included in the analysis were aged 55 to 70 years without dementia at baseline (calendar years 2006 to 2010), underwent genotyping, and reported on eye conditions; a subset completed visual acuity examinations (n = 69 852-71 429) or brain imaging (n = 36591-36 855). Data were analyzed from August 15, 2022, through November 28, 2023. Exposure: Self-reported cataracts, visual acuity, and myopia measured by refraction error. Main Outcomes and Measures: ADRD, AD, and vascular dementia were identified from electronic medical records. Total and regional brain volumes were determined using magnetic resonance imaging. Results: The sample included 304953 participants (mean [SD] age, 62.1 (4.1) years; 163825 women [53.72%]); 14295 (4.69%) had cataracts and 2754 (3.86%) had worse than 20/40 vision. Cataracts (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.07-1.29) and myopia (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.06-1.70) were associated with a higher hazard of ADRD. In MR analyses to estimate potential causal effects, cataracts were associated with increased risk of vascular dementia (inverse variance-weighted odds ratio [OR], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.26-2.92) but were not associated with increased dementia (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.98-1.50). There were no associations between myopia and dementia. In MR for potential reverse causality, AD was not associated with cataracts (inverse variance-weighted OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96-1.01). Genetic risk for cataracts was associated with smaller total brain (β = -597.43 mm3; 95% CI, -1077.87 to -117.00 mm3) and gray matter (β = -375.17 mm3; 95% CI, -680.10 to -70.24 mm3) volumes, but not other brain regions. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort and MR study of UK Biobank participants, cataracts were associated with increased risk of dementia, especially vascular dementia, and reduced total brain volumes. These findings lend further support to the hypothesis that cataract extraction may reduce the risk for dementia. © 2024 American Medical Association.

The present study aims to investigate the impact of NBVRs on the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementia disorders in real-world clinical practice. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data of 112 memory clinic patients, who were consecutively referred for MRI and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) during a 12-month period. Structural MRI was assessed by two residents with 2 and 3 years of neuroimaging experience. Statements and diagnostic confidence regarding the presence of a neurodegenerative disorder in general (first level) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pattern in particular (second level) were recorded without and with NBVR information. FDG-PET served as the reference standard. Results: Overall, despite a trend towards increased accuracy, the impact of NBVRs on diagnostic accuracy was low and non-significant. We found a significant drop of sensitivity (0.75–0.58; p < 0.001) and increase of specificity (0.62–0.85; p < 0.001) for rater 1 at identifying patients with neurodegenerative dementia disorders. Diagnostic confidence increased for rater 2 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Overall, NBVRs had a limited impact on diagnostic accuracy in real-world clinical practice. Potentially, NBVR might increase diagnostic specificity and confidence of neuroradiology residents. To this end, a well-defined framework for integration of NBVR in the diagnostic process and improved algorithms of NBVR generation are essential.

A spectrum of T/N/I imaging and plasma biomarkers was acquired in a phase 2 clinical trial of rasagiline in mild to moderate AD patients. We evaluated these to understand biomarker distributions and relationships within this population. METHODS: Plasma biomarkers of pTau-181, neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), other inflammation-related proteins, imaging measures including fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), flortaucipir PET, and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive endpoints were analyzed to assess characteristics and relationships for the overall population (N = 47 at baseline and N = 21 for longitudinal cognitive comparisons) and within age-decade subgroups (57-69, 70-79, 80-90 years). RESULTS: Data demonstrate wide clinical and biomarker heterogeneity in this population influenced by age and sex. Plasma pTau-181 and GFAP correlate with tau PET, most strongly in left inferior temporal cortex (p = 0.0002, p = 0.0006, respectively). In regions beyond temporal cortex, tau PET uptake decreased with age for the same pTau-181 or GFAP concentrations. FDG PET and brain volumes correlate with tau PET in numerous regions (such as inferior temporal: p = 0.0007, p = 0.00001, respectively). NfL, GFAP, and all imaging modalities correlate with baseline MMSE; subsequent MMSE decline is predicted by baseline parahippocampal and lateral temporal tau PET (p = 0.0007) and volume (p = 0.0006). Lateral temporal FDG PET (p = 0.006) and volume (p = 0.0001) are most strongly associated with subsequent ADAS-cog decline. NfL correlates with FDG PET and baseline MMSE but not tau PET. Inflammation biomarkers are intercorrelated but correlated with other biomarkers in only the youngest group. DISCUSSION: Associations between plasma biomarkers, imaging biomarkers, and cognitive status observed in this study provide insight into relationships among biological processes in mild to moderate AD. Findings show the potential to characterize AD patients regarding likely tau pathology, neurodegeneration, prospective clinical decline, and the importance of covariates such as age. Highlights: Plasma pTau-181 and GFAP correlated with regional and global tau PET in mild to moderate AD. NfL correlated with FDG PET and cognitive endpoints but not plasma pTau-181 or tau PET. Volume and FDG PET showed strong relationships to tau PET, one another, and cognitive status. Temporal volumes most strongly predicted decline in both MMSE and ADAS-cog. Volume and plasma biomarkers can enrich for elevated tau PET with age a significant covariate. © 2024 The Author(s).

Machine learning (ML) may be able to address this challenge. The aim of this study was to develop and interpret a ML algorithm capable of differentiating Alzheimer’s dementia, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and cognitively normal control subjects based on sociodemographic, clinical, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) variables. 506 subjects from 5 databases were included. MRI images were processed with FreeSurfer, LPA, and TRACULA to obtain brain volumes and thicknesses, white matter lesions and diffusion metrics. MRI metrics were used in conjunction with clinical and demographic data to perform differential diagnosis based on a Support Vector Machine model called MUQUBIA (Multimodal Quantification of Brain whIte matter biomArkers). Age, gender, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Dementia Staging Instrument, and 19 imaging features formed the best set of discriminative features. The predictive model performed with an overall Area Under the Curve of 98%, high overall precision (88%), recall (88%), and F1 scores (88%) in the test group, and good Label Ranking Average Precision score (0.95) in a subset of neuropathologically assessed patients.

This can be used to turn classification problems based on longitudinal data into simpler image classification problems, allowing image-based deep learning methods to be applied to longitudinal measurements. Our approach is applicable to situations with balanced or imbalanced longitudinal data sets and where there are missing data at some time points. To evaluate our approach, we apply it to an important and challenging task: the prediction of dementia from brain volume trajectories derived from longitudinal MRI. We construct an ensemble of convolutional neural network models to classify two groups of subjects: those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment at all examinations (stable MCI) versus those starting out as MCI but later converting to Alzheimer’s disease (converted AD). Models were trained on image representations derived from N=736 subjects sourced from the ADNI database (471/265 sMCI/cAD). We obtained an accuracy of a resulting ensemble model of 76%, measured on an independent test set. Our approach is simple and easy to apply but competitive (in terms of accuracy), with results reported in other machine learning approaches with similar classification on comparable tasks. This indicates that this approach can lead to useful representations of longitudinal data. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Alzheimer’s disease; Convolutional neural networks; Longitudinal data; Mild cognitive impairment; MRI","Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image classification; Image representation; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Alzheimer; Alzheimer’s disease; Cognitive impairment; Convolutional neural network; Images classification; Longitudinal data; Mild cognitive impairment; One-dimensional; Simple++; Two-dimensional; Magnetic resonance imaging","S.A.

Objective: To investigate retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and its association with brain volume via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in older adults with subjective or objective cognitive decline. Methods: 75 participants underwent ophthalmological and neurological evaluation including optical coherence tomography and MRI (28 cognitively normal subjects, 26 with subjective cognitive decline, 17 patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, and 4 with AD). Differences in demographics, thickness of RNFL, and brain volume were assessed using ANCOVA, while partial Pearson correlations, covaried for age and sex, were used to compare thickness of the peripapillary RNFL with brain volumes, with p<0.05 considered statistically significant. Results: Mean RNFL thickness was significantly correlated with brain volumes, including global volume (right eye r=0.235 p=0.046, left eye r=0.244, p=0.037), temporal lobe (right eye r=0.242 p=0.039, left eye r=0.290, p=0.013), hippocampal (right eye r=0.320 p=0.005, left eye r=0.306, p=0.008), amygdala (left eye r=0.332, p=0.004), and occipital lobe (right eye r=0.264 p=0.024) volumes. Conclusion: RNFL thickness in both eyes was positively associated with brain volumes in subjects with subjective and objective cognitive decline. The RNFL, however, did not correlate with the disease, but the small sample number makes it important to conduct larger studies. RNFL thickness may be a useful non-invasive and inexpensive tool for detection of brain neurodegeneration and may assist with diagnosis and monitoring of progression and treatment in AD.  © 2023-IOS Press.

Of note, few studies explored that transition from a multifactorial perspective, taking into consideration the effect of basic factors such as biological sex. In the present study 96 subjects with MCI (37 males and 59 females) were followed-up and divided into two subgroups according to their clinical outcome: “progressive” MCI (pMCI = 41), if they fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for AD at the end of follow-up; and “stable” MCI (sMCI = 55), if they remained with the initial diagnosis. Different markers were combined to characterize sex differences between groups, including magnetoencephalography recordings, cognitive performance, and brain volumes derived from magnetic resonance imaging. Results indicated that the pMCI group exhibited higher low-frequency activity, lower scores in neuropsychological tests and reduced brain volumes than the sMCI group, being these measures significantly correlated. When sex was considered, results revealed that this pattern was mainly due to the influence of the females’ sample. Overall, females exhibited lower cognitive scores and reduced brain volumes. More interestingly, females in the pMCI group showed an increased theta activity that correlated with a more abrupt reduction of cognitive and volumetric scores as compared with females in the sMCI group and with males in the pMCI group. These findings suggest that females’ brains might be more vulnerable to the effects of AD pathology, since regardless of age, they showed signs of more pronounced deterioration than males. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American Aging Association.","Alzheimer’s disease; Brain volumes; Cognition; Mild cognitive impairment; Neurophysiological activity; Sex differences","Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Sex Characteristics; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain size; clinical outcome; cognition assessment; controlled study; deterioration; disease course; female; follow up; high risk population; human; magnetoencephalography; major clinical study; male; mental performance; mild cognitive impairment; neuropsychological assessment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; sex difference; vulnerable population; Alzheimer disease; brain; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; pathology; procedures; sexual characteristics","M.E.

In particular, a specific pattern of brain volume atrophy is the most profound risk factor for cognitive impairment, including AD, that is directly linked to aging. Thus, this study aimed to investigate knowledge on the early detection of AD in postmenopausal women, focusing on the volume changes of the subcortical regions, including the thalamic subnuclei, in women with AD vs. postmenopausal women. Twenty-one women with AD and twenty-one postmenopausal women without AD underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Women with AD showed significantly reduced volumes in the hippocampus, thalamus, and amygdala compared with postmenopausal women (p < 0.05, FWE-corrected). After adjustments for age, the right hippocampal volume was found to be significantly lower in the women with AD, but the volumes of the thalamus and amygdala were relatively unaffected. The women with AD exhibited significantly reduced volume in the right laterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus compared with the postmenopausal women (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected). Our findings suggest that the reduced volume of both the right laterodorsal thalamic nucleus and right hippocampus may serve as a potential biomarker for the early detection of AD in postmenopausal women. © 2023 by the authors.","Alzheimer’s disease; brain volume; early detection; postmenopausal women; thalamic nuclei","estradiol; estriol; estrogen; follitropin; luteinizing hormone; sex hormone binding globulin; testosterone; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; amygdala; anterior commissure; anteroventral nucleus; Article; brain mapping; brain region; brain size; central lateral nucleus; centromedian nucleus; chemiluminescence immunoassay; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; early diagnosis; estradiol blood level; estriol blood level; estrogen blood level; female; follitropin blood level; gray matter; gray matter volume; health care; hippocampus; human; hypothesis; image segmentation; lateral geniculate body; laterodorsal nucleus; laterodorsal posterior nucleus; left hemisphere; luteinizing hormone blood level; magnocellular nucleus; medial geniculate body; mediodorsal lateral parvocellular; middle aged; Mini Mental State Examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; paracentral nucleus; paratenial nucleus; parvocellular reticular nucleus; posterior commissure; postmenopause; predictive value; pulvinar; pulvinar anterior; pulvinar inferior; pulvinar medial; radioimmunoassay; reuniens nucleus; right hemisphere; right hippocampus; sensitivity and specificity; T1 weighted imaging; testosterone blood level; thalamic subnuclear volumetry; thalamus anterior nucleus; thalamus intralaminar nucleus; thalamus lateral nucleus; thalamus midline nucleus; thalamus nucleus; thalamus parafascicular nucleus; thalamus posterior nucleus; thalamus ventral nucleus; three dimensional magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo; three-dimensional imaging; ventral anterior nucleus; ventral lateral anterior nucleus; ventral posterolateral nucleus; volumetry; white matter; Youden index","G.-W.

However, very few studies have considered brain age prediction as a biomarker for the conversion of cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this study, we developed a novel brain age prediction model using brain volume and cortical thickness features. We calculated an acceleration of brain age (ABA) derived from the suggested model to estimate different diagnostic groups (CN, MCI, and AD) and to classify CN to MCI and MCI to AD conversion groups. We observed a strong association between ABA and the 3 diagnostic groups. Additionally, the classification models for CN to MCI conversion and MCI to AD conversion exhibited acceptable and robust performances, with area under the curve values of 0.66 and 0.76, respectively. We believe that our proposed model provides a reliable estimate of brain age for elderly individuals and can identify those at risk of progressing from CN to MCI. This model has great potential to reveal a diagnosis associated with a change in cognitive decline. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.

The sharp rise in the number of AD patients has brought it within the top eight health issues in the world. It is associated with the distribution of misfolded aggregates of protein within the brain. However, Alois Alzheimer initially mentioned that the reduction in brain volume in AD might be associated with the “deposition of a special substance in the cortex”. The resulting plaque found in extracellular space in the AD brain and hippocampus region, known as senile plaques, is the characteristic feature underlying Alzheimer’s pathology, where the role of amy-loid-β (Aβ) peptide formation from proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by secre-tase enzyme is eminent. Therefore, this review has highlighted the molecular pathophysiology of AD with a variety of available diagnostic and treatment strategies for the management of the disease, with a focus on the advancement toward clinical research to provide new effective and safe tool in the diagnosis, treatment or management of AD. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.","Alzheimer’s disease; amyloid precursor protein; biomarker; neurodegenerative; neuroimaging; secretase enzyme","Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Disease Progression; Humans; Plaque, Amyloid; ADAM10 endopeptidase; ADAMTS9 protein; aducanumab; amyloid precursor protein; bevacizumab; biological marker; cholinesterase inhibitor; donepezil; estrogen receptor; galantamine; memantine; natalizumab; nicastrin; prazosin; presenilin 1; rivastigmine; secretase; tacrine; tau protein; tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme; valaciclovir; amyloid beta protein; secretase; Alzheimer disease; blood brain barrier; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical dementia rating scale; clinical trial (topic); disease exacerbation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; immune response; insulin resistance; mass spectrometry; nerve degeneration; neuroimaging; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; positron emission tomography; Review; single photon emission computed tomography; Alzheimer disease; amyloid plaque; disease exacerbation","P.

However, most biomarker studies, particularly in neuroimaging, have analysed artificially ‘clean’ research groups, free from comorbidities, erroneous referrals, contraindications and from a narrow sociodemographic pool. Such biases mean that neuroimaging samples are often unrepresentative of the target population for dementia risk (e.g., people referred to a memory clinic), limiting the generalisation of these studies to real-world clinical settings. To facilitate better translation from research to the clinic, datasets that are more representative of dementia patient groups are warranted. Methods: We analysed T1-weighted MRI scans from a real-world setting of patients referred to UK memory clinic services (n = 1140; 60.2 % female and mean [SD] age of 70.0[10.8] years) to derive ‘brain-age’. Brain-age is an index of age-related brain health based on quantitative analysis of structural neuroimaging, largely reflecting brain atrophy. Brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) was calculated as brain-age minus chronological age. We determined which patients went on to develop dementia between three months and 7.8 years after neuroimaging assessment (n = 476) using linkage to electronic health records. Results: Survival analysis, using Cox regression, indicated a 3 % increased risk of dementia per brain-PAD year (hazard ratio [95 % CI] = 1.03 [1.02,1.04], p < 0.0001), adjusted for baseline age, age2, sex, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and normalised brain volume. In sensitivity analyses, brain-PAD remained significant when time-to-dementia was at least 3 years (hazard ratio [95 % CI] = 1.06 [1.02, 1.09], p = 0.0006), or when baseline MMSE score ≥ 27 (hazard ratio [95 % CI] = 1.03 [1.01, 1.05], p = 0.0006). Conclusions: Memory clinic patients with older‐appearing brains are more likely to receive a subsequent dementia diagnosis. Potentially, brain-age could aid decision-making during initial memory clinic assessment to improve early detection of dementia. Even when neuroimaging assessment was more than 3 years prior to diagnosis and when cognitive functioning was not clearly impaired, brain-age still proved informative. These real-world results support the use of quantitative neuroimaging biomarkers like brain-age in memory clinics. © 2022 The Authors","Ageing; Brain-age; Dementia; Ecological validity; Electronic health records; Machine learning","Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Biomarkers; Brain; Child; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuroimaging; biological marker; Alzheimer disease; atrophy; brain; child; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; female; human; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology","F.

We aimed to evaluate the timing, neuroanatomy and prognostic implications of depression in PD. Methods We used data from 434 023 participants from UK Biobank with 14.1 years of follow-up. Multivariable regression models established associations of depression with incident PD and regional brain volumes. Cox proportional hazards models assessed prognostic associations of depression in PD with incident dementia and all-cause mortality. Results Of 2632 individuals with incident PD, 539 (20.5%) were diagnosed with depression at some point. Depression was associated with an increased risk of subsequent PD (risk ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.72). Among incident PD cases, depression prevalence rose progressively from 10 years pre-PD diagnosis (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.83) to 10 years postdiagnosis (OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.33 to 9.22). Depression severity in PD was associated with reduced grey matter volume in structures including the thalamus and amygdala. Depression prior to PD diagnosis increased risk of dementia (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.07) and mortality (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.58). Conclusions This large-scale prospective study demonstrated that depression prevalence increases from 10 years before PD diagnosis and is a marker of cortical and subcortical volume loss. Depression before PD diagnosis signals a worse prognosis in terms of dementia and mortality. This has clinical implications in stratifying people with poorer cognitive and prognostic trajectory in PD. © 2024 BMJ Publishing Group.

The model was optimized using brain volumes measured with a standard tool FreeSurfer. Objective: Here we further verified the prediction model using newly estimated brain volumes from Neuro I, a quantitative brain analysis system developed for Korean populations. Methods: Lobar and subcortical volumes were estimated from MRI images of 1,629 normal Korean and 786 Caucasian subjects (age range 59-89) and were predicted in linear regression from ethnicity, age, sex, intracranial volume, magnetic field strength, and scanner manufacturers. Results: In the regression model predicting the new volumes, ethnicity was again a substantial predictor in most regions. Additionally, the model-based z-scores of regions were calculated for 428 AD patients and the matched controls, and then employed for diagnostic classification. When the AD classifier adopted the z-scores adjusted for ethnicity, the diagnostic accuracy has noticeably improved (AUC = 0.85, ΔAUC = + 0.04, D = 4.10, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the prediction model remains robust across different measurement tool, and ethnicity significantly contributes to the establishment of norms for brain volumes and the development of a diagnostic system for neurodegenerative diseases.","Alzheimer’s disease; brain aging; ethnic difference; magnetic resonance imaging; norm","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Asian People; Brain; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size; White People; aged; Alzheimer disease; Asian; brain; Caucasian; diagnostic imaging; ethnology; female; human; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; very elderly","","","","18758908","","","38640153","English","J Alzheimers Dis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192113187"

Clinical and neuroimaging measures were acquired from 301 CN adults who converted to CI within 15 years of baseline, and 294 who did not. Regional volumes and brain age measures were extracted from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Linear discriminant analysis compared non-converters’ characteristics against those of short-, mid-, and long-term converters. Conversion was associated with clinical measures such as hearing impairment and self-reported memory decline. Converters’ brain volumes were smaller than non-converters’ across 48 frontal, temporal, and subcortical structures. Brain age measures of 12 structures were correlated with shorter times to conversion. Conversion prediction accuracy increased from 81.5% to 90.5% as time to conversion decreased.

The research gap reveals information on the lack of an automatic non-invasive approach toward the diagnosis of AD, in particular with the help of Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence. Another perspective highlights that current VR studies fail to incorporate a comprehensive range of cognitive tests and consider design notes for elderlies, leading to unreliable results. Methods: This paper tried to design a VR environment suitable for older adults in which three cognitive assessments namely: ADAS-Cog, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), are implemented. Moreover, a 3DCNN-ML model was trained based on the corresponding cognitive tests and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with different modalities using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 (ADNI2) dataset and incorporated into the application to predict if the patient suffers from AD. Results: The model has undergone three experiments with different modalities (Cognitive Scores (CS), MRI images, and CS-MRI). As for the CS-MRI experiment, the trained model achieved 97%, 95%, 95%, 96%, and 94% in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and accuracy respectively. The considered design notes were also assessed using a new proposed questionnaire based on existing ones in terms of user experience, user interface, mechanics, in-env assistance, and VR induced symptoms and effects. The designed VR system provided an acceptable level of user experience, with participants reporting an enjoyable and immersive experience. While there were areas for improvement, including graphics and sound quality, as well as comfort issues with prolonged HMD use, the user interface and mechanics of the system were generally well-received. Conclusions: The reported results state that our method's comprehensive analysis of 3D brain volumes and incorporation of cognitive scores enabled earlier detection of AD progression, potentially allowing for timely interventions and improved patient outcomes. The proposed integrated system provided us with promising insights for improvements in the diagnosis of AD using technologies. © 2024","3DCNN-ML; Alzheimer's disease; Artificial intelligence; Cognitive assessment; Multimodal data; The metaverse; Virtual reality","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Artificial Intelligence; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Neuroimaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Virtual Reality; Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neuroimaging; Patient treatment; Statistical tests; User interfaces; Virtual reality; 3DCNN-ML; Alzheimers disease; Cognitive assessments; Cognitive tests; Disease diagnosis; Early diagnosis; Multi-modal data; The metaverse; Users' experiences; accuracy; Alzheimer disease; Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale; Article; classifier; clinical assessment; comparative study; cross validation; deep neural network; disease exacerbation; disorientation; dizziness; human; mechanics; medical history; Mini Mental State Examination; Montreal cognitive assessment; nausea; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physical examination; timbre; virtual reality; aged; Alzheimer disease; artificial intelligence; dementia assessment; diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; female; male; neuroimaging; neuropsychological assessment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; very elderly; virtual reality; Disease control","S.-M.

With an automated analysis program Quick Brain Volumetry (QBraVo) developed for volumetric measurements, we measured regional volumes and ratios to evaluate their performance in discriminating AD dementia (ADD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients from normal controls (NC). Validation of QBraVo was based on intra-rater and inter-rater reliability with a manual measurement. The regional volumes and ratios to total intracranial volume (TIV) and to total brain volume (TBV) or total cerebrospinal fluid volume (TCV) were compared among subjects. The regional volume to total cerebellar volume ratio named Standardized Atrophy Volume Ratio (SAVR) was calculated to compare brain atrophy. Diagnostic performances to distinguish among NC, MCI, and ADD were compared between MMSE, SAVR, and the predictive model. In total, 56 NCs, 44 MCI, and 45 ADD patients were enrolled. The average run time of QBraVo was 5 min 36 seconds. Intra-rater reliability was 0.999. Inter-rater reliability was high for TBV, TCV, and TIV (R = 0.97, 0.89 and 0.93, respectively). The medial temporal SAVR showed the highest performance for discriminating ADD from NC (AUC = 0.808, diagnostic accuracy = 80.2%). The predictive model using both MMSE and medial temporal SAVR improved the diagnostic performance for MCI in NC (AUC = 0.844, diagnostic accuracy = 79%). Our results demonstrated QBraVo is a fast and accurate method to measure brain volume. The regional volume calculated as SAVR could help to diagnose ADD and MCI and increase diagnostic accuracy for MCI. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Alzheimer’s disease; Cognitive dysfunction; Computer-assisted image processing; Dementia; Magnetic resonance imaging","Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain atrophy; brain region; brain size; cerebrospinal fluid; comparative study; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; female; human; interrater reliability; intrarater reliability; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observational study; retrospective study; standardized atrophy volume ratio; task performance; validation study; volumetry; atrophy; brain; cognitive defect; complication; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures; reproducibility","D.W.

Overlapping tremor features can be challenging to diagnosis and misdiagnosis is common. Although underlying neurodegenerative mechanisms are suggested, neuroimaging studies arrived at controversial results and often the different tremor types were not considered. We investigated whether different tremor types displayed distinct structural brain features. Structural MRI of 61 patients with essential tremor and 29 with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease was analysed using a fully automated artificial-intelligence-based brain volumetry to compare volumes of several cortical and subcortical regions. Furthermore, essential tremor subgroups with and without rest tremor or more pronounced postural and kinetic tremor were investigated. Deviations from an internal reference collective of age- and sex-adjusted healthy controls and volumetric differences between groups were examined; regression analysis was used to determine the contribution of disease-related factors on volumetric measurements. Compared with healthy controls, essential tremor and tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease patients displayed deviations in the occipital lobes, hippocampus, putamen, pallidum and mesencephalon while essential tremor patients exhibited decreased volumes within the nucleus caudatus and thalamus. Analysis of covariance revealed similar volumetric patterns in both diseases. Essential tremor patients without rest tremor showed a significant atrophy within the thalamus compared to tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease and atrophy of the mesencephalon and putamen were found in both subgroups compared to essential tremor with rest tremor. Disease-related factors contribute to volumes of occipital lobes in both diseases and to volumes of temporal lobes in essential tremor and the putamen in Parkinson's disease. Fully automated artificial-intelligence-based volumetry provides a fast and rater-independent method to investigate brain volumes in different neurological disorders and allows comparisons with an internal reference collective. Our results indicate that essential tremor and tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease share structural changes, indicative of neurodegenerative mechanisms, particularly of the basal-ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry. A discriminating, possibly disease-specific involvement of the thalamus was found in essential tremor patients without rest tremor and the mesencephalon and putamen in tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease and essential tremor without rest tremor.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Method: High-resolution T1-weighted images were obtained to measure cortical thickness (CT), gyrification, gyrification index (GI), sulcal depth (SD), fractal dimension (FD), and brain volumes. After the feature selection step, ML classifiers were applied for each feature set and the combination of them. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique was implemented to interpret the contribution of each feature. Findings: 144 adolescents (16.2 ± 1.4 years, female = 39%) with EOS (n = 81) and EBD (n = 63) were included. The Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm had the highest accuracy (82.75%) in the whole dataset that includes all variables from Destrieux atlas. The best-performing algorithms were K-nearest neighbors (KNN) for FD subset, support vector machine (SVM) for SD subset, and AdaBoost for GI subset.

The neuropsychological battery of the Uniform Data Set (UDSNB3.0) assesses cognition in ageing and dementia, by measuring scores across different cognitive domains such as attention, memory, processing speed, executive function and language. However, its neuroanatomical correlates have not been investigated using 7 Tesla MRI (7T MRI). Methods: We used 7T MRI to investigate the correlations between hippocampal subfield volumes and the UDSNB3.0 in 24 individuals with Amyloidβ-status AD and 18 age-matched controls, with respective age ranges of 60 (42–76) and 62 (52–79) years. AD participants with a Medial Temporal Atrophy scale of higher than 2 on 3T MRI were excluded from the study. Results: A significant difference in the entire hippocampal volume was observed in the AD group compared to healthy controls (HC), primarily influenced by CA1, the largest hippocampal subfield. Notably, no significant difference in whole brain volume between the groups implied that hippocampal volume loss was not merely reflective of overall brain atrophy. UDSNB3.0 cognitive scores showed significant differences between AD and HC, particularly in Memory, Language, and Visuospatial domains. The volume of the Dentate Gyrus (DG) showed a significant association with the Memory and Executive domain scores in AD patients as assessed by the UDSNB3.0. The data also suggested a non-significant trend for CA1 volume associated with UDSNB3.0 Memory, Executive, and Language domain scores in AD. In a reassessment focusing on hippocampal subfields and MoCA memory subdomains in AD, associations were observed between the DG and Cued, Uncued, and Recognition Memory subscores, whereas CA1 and Tail showed associations only with Cued memory. Discussion: This study reveals differences in the hippocampal volumes measured using 7T MRI, between individuals with early symptomatic AD compared with healthy controls. This highlights the potential of 7T MRI as a valuable tool for early AD diagnosis and the real-time monitoring of AD progression and treatment efficacy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if CAA pathology partly mediates reduced hippocampal volume in patients with AD. METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD and neuropathological confirmation of AD+/-CAA in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database were included in the study. The volumes of temporal lobe structures were calculated on T1-weighted imaging (T1-MRI) using automated FreeSurfer software, from images acquired on average 5 years prior to death. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to compare brain volumes in four CAA groups. The hippocampal volume on T1-MRI was correlated with Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes (CDRsb) score, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and hippocampal atrophy at autopsy. RESULTS: The study included 231 patients with no (n = 45), mild (n = 70), moderate (n = 67), and severe (n = 49) CAA. Among the four CAA groups, patients with severe CAA had a smaller mean left hippocampal volume (p = 0.023) but this was not significant when adjusted for APOE ɛ4 (p = 0.07). The left hippocampal volume on MRI correlated significantly with the hippocampal atrophy grading on neuropathology (p = 0.0003). Among patients with severe CAA, the left hippocampal volume on T1-MRI: (a) decreased with an increase in the number of APOE ɛ4 alleles (p = 0.04); but (b) had no evidence of correlation with CDRsb score (p = 0.57). CONCLUSION: Severe CAA was associated with smaller left hippocampal volume on T1-MRI up to five years prior to death among patients with neuropathologically confirmed AD. This relationship was dependent on APOE ɛ4 genotype.","Alzheimer’s disease; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; hippocampus; trophy","Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E4; Apolipoproteins E; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Hippocampus; Humans; apolipoprotein E; apolipoprotein E4; Alzheimer disease; diagnostic imaging; genetics; hippocampus; human; pathology; vascular amyloidosis","","","NLM (Medline)","18758908","","","37038809","English","J Alzheimers Dis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159779105"

Although the hippocampus is often one of the earliest brain regions to undergo change in the AD process, we do not know how early in the lifespan such changes might occur or whether they differ early in the lifespan as a function of family history of AD. Using a rare sample, young adults with a parent with late-onset dementia, we investigated whether brain abnormalities could already be detected compared with a matched sample. Moreover, we employed simple yet novel techniques to characterize resting brain activity (mean and standard deviation) and brain volume in the hippocampus. Young adults with a parent with dementia showed greater resting mean activity and smaller volumes in the left hippocampus compared to young adults without a parent with dementia. Having a parent with AD or a related dementia was associated with early aberrations in brain function and structure. This early hippocampal dysfunction may be due to aberrant neural firing, which may increase the risk for a diagnosis of dementia in old age. © 2022 by the authors.

This work aimed to find T1-weighted MRI-based markers for AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to improve the screening process. Objective: Our assumption was to build a screening model that would be accessible and easy to use for physicians in their daily clinical routine. Methods: The multinomial logistic regression was used to detect status: AD, MCI, and normal control (NC) combined with the Bayesian information criterion for model selection. Several T1-weighted MRI-based radiomic features were considered explanatory variables in the prediction model. Results: The best radiomic predictor was the relative brain volume. The proposed method confirmed its quality by achieving a balanced accuracy of 95.18%, AUC of 93.25%, NPV of 97.93%, and PPV of 90.48% for classifying AD versus NC for the European DTI Study on Dementia (EDSD). The comparison of the two models: with the MMSE score only as an independent variable and corrected for the relative brain value and age, shows that the addition of the T1-weighted MRI-based biomarker improves the quality of MCI detection (AUC: 67.04% versus 71.08%) while maintaining quality for AD (AUC: 93.35% versus 93.25%). Additionally, among MCI patients predicted as AD inconsistently with the original diagnosis, 60% from ADNI and 76.47% from EDSD were re-diagnosed as AD within a 48-month follow-up. It shows that our model can detect AD patients a few years earlier than a standard medical diagnosis. Conclusion: The created method is non-invasive, inexpensive, clinically accessible, and efficiently supports AD/MCI screening.  © 2023 - The authors.

Objective: This preliminary case-control study investigates whether the temporal organization of speech is associated with the volume of brain regions involved in overt sentence reading and explores the discriminative ability of temporal speech parameters and standard volumetric MRI measures for the classification of MCI and AD. Methods: Individuals with MCI, mild-to-moderate AD, and healthy controls (HC) had a structural MRI scan and read aloud sentences varying in cognitive-linguistic demand (length). The association between speech features and regional brain volumes was examined by linear mixed-effect modeling. Genetic programming was used to explore the discriminative ability of temporal and MRI features. Results: Longer sentences, slower speech rate, and a higher number of pauses and shorter interpausal units were associated with reduced volumes of the reading network. Speech-based classifiers performed similarly to the MRI-based classifiers for MCI-HC (67% vs. 68%) and slightly better for AD-HC (80% vs. 64%) and AD-MCI (82% vs. 59%). Adding the speech features to the MRI features slightly im-proved the performance of MRI-based classification for AD-HC and MCI-HC but not HC-MCI. Conclusion: The temporal organization of speech in overt sentence reading reflects underlying volume reductions. It may represent a sensitive marker for early assessment of structural changes and cogni-tive-linguistic deficits associated with healthy aging, MCI, and AD. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.","Alzheimer disease; cognitive aging; functional neuroimaging; genetic programming; machine learning; mild cognitive impairment; sentence reading; temporal speech features","Alzheimer Disease; Case-Control Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction; Humans; Language; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; aged; Alzheimer disease; amygdala; angular gyrus; Article; attention; brain region; brain size; case control study; cephalometry; cerebellum; classifier; clinical article; cognition; cognitive aging; cognitive linguistic demand; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease classification; disease severity; entorhinal cortex; feature extraction; female; functional neuroimaging; fusiform gyrus; Go No Go task; gray matter; hemisphere; hippocampus; human; inferior frontal gyrus; inferior parietal lobule; inferior temporal gyrus; insula; language; male; memory; middle temporal gyrus; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; Montreal cognitive assessment; neuroanatomy; neuroimaging; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; overt sentence reading; parietal gyrus; pars opercularis; pars orbitalis; pars triangularis; precuneus; reading; repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status; slowness; speech disorder; speech rate; speech test; standard; superior frontal gyrus; superior temporal gyrus; supramarginal gyrus; sustained attention to response task; temporal cortex; voice parameter; volumetry; working memory; Alzheimer disease; cognitive defect; complication; diagnostic imaging","C.

Objective: To assess distinct neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD using novel semisupervised machine learning methods and to test whether the dimensions can serve as endophenotypes also in non-ASD populations. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used imaging data from the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) repositories as the discovery cohort. The ABIDE sample included individuals diagnosed with ASD aged between 16 and 64 years and age- and sex-match typically developing individuals. Validation cohorts included individuals with schizophrenia from the Psychosis Heterogeneity Evaluated via Dimensional Neuroimaging (PHENOM) consortium and individuals from the UK Biobank to represent the general population. The multisite discovery cohort included 16 internationally distributed imaging sites. Analyses were performed between March 2021 and March 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: The trained semisupervised heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models were tested for reproducibility using extensive cross-validations. It was then applied to individuals from the PHENOM and the UK Biobank. It was hypothesized that neuroanatomical dimensions of ASD would display distinct clinical and genetic profiles and would be prominent also in non-ASD populations. Results: Heterogeneity through discriminative analysis models trained on T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance images of 307 individuals with ASD (mean [SD] age, 25.4 [9.8] years; 273 [88.9%] male) and 362 typically developing control individuals (mean [SD] age, 25.8 [8.9] years; 309 [85.4%] male) revealed that a 3-dimensional scheme was optimal to capture the ASD neuroanatomy. The first dimension (A1: aginglike) was associated with smaller brain volume, lower cognitive function, and aging-related genetic variants (FOXO3; Z = 4.65; P = 1.62 × 10-6). The second dimension (A2: schizophrenialike) was characterized by enlarged subcortical volumes, antipsychotic medication use (Cohen d = 0.65; false discovery rate-adjusted P =.048), partially overlapping genetic, neuroanatomical characteristics to schizophrenia (n = 307), and significant genetic heritability estimates in the general population (n = 14786; mean [SD] h2, 0.71 [0.04]; P < 1 × 10-4). The third dimension (A3: typical ASD) was distinguished by enlarged cortical volumes, high nonverbal cognitive performance, and biological pathways implicating brain development and abnormal apoptosis (mean [SD] β, 0.83 [0.02]; P = 4.22 × 10-6). Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study discovered 3-dimensional endophenotypic representation that may elucidate the heterogeneous neurobiological underpinnings of ASD to support precision diagnostics. The significant correspondence between A2 and schizophrenia indicates a possibility of identifying common biological mechanisms across the 2 mental health diagnoses..  © 2023 American Medical Association.

It remains unclear whether there are specific differences in subcortical volumes between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and whether the subcortical differences are affected by any clinical characteristics. We investigated differences in subcortical volumes bilaterally among patients with schizophrenia, patients with bipolar disorder and healthy controls. We also investigated the influences of clinical characteristics on specific subcortical volumes in these patient groups. Methods: We collected 3 T T1-weighted MRI brain scans from 413 participants (157 with schizophrenia, 51 with bipolar disorder and 205 controls) with a single scanner at a single institute. We used FreeSurfer version 6.0 for processing the T1-weighted images to segment the following subcortical brain volumes: thala-mus, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. Differences in the 7 subcortical volumes were investigated among the groups. We also evaluated correlations between subcortical volumes and clinical variables in these patient groups. Results: Of 7 subcortical regions, patients with schizophrenia had significantly smaller volumes in the left thalamus (Cohen d = –0.29, p = 5.83 × 10−3), bilateral hippocampi (left, d = –0.36, p = 8.85 × 10−4; right, d = –0.41, p = 1.15 × 10−4) and left amygdala (d = −0.31, p = 4.02 × 10−3) than controls. Compared with controls, patients with bipolar disorder had bilateral reductions only in the hippocampal volumes (left, d = –0.52, p = 1.12 × 10−3; right, d = –0.58, p = 0.30 × 10−4). We also found that patients with schizophrenia had significantly smaller volumes in the bilateral amygdalae (left, d = –0.43, p = 4.22 × 10−3; right, d = –0.45, p = 4.56 × 10−3) than patients with bipolar disorder. We did not find any significant volumetric differences in the other 6 subcortical structures between patient groups (p > 0.05). Smaller left amygdalar volumes were significantly correlated with younger onset age only in patients with schizophrenia (r = 0.22, p = 5.78 × 10−3). Limitations: We did not evaluate the differences in sub-cortical volumes between patients stratified based on clinical bipolar disorder subtype and a history of psychotic episodes because our sample size of patients with bipolar disorder was limited. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that volumetric differences in the amygdala between patients with schizophrenia and those with bipolar disorder may be a putative biomarker for distinguishing 2 clinically similar diagnoses. © 2022 CMA Impact Inc. or its licensors.","","Bipolar Disorder; Brain; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Psychotic Disorders; Putamen; Schizophrenia; biperiden; chlorpromazine; adult; amygdala; Article; bipolar disorder; brain size; clinical feature; controlled study; disease duration; DSM-5; DSM-IV; education; female; globus pallidus; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; hippocampus; human; human experiment; intelligence quotient; major clinical study; male; middle aged; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nucleus accumbens; onset age; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; putamen; schizophrenia; subcortex; T1 weighted imaging; thalamus; therapeutic equivalent dose; Young Mania Rating Scale; bipolar disorder; brain; diagnostic imaging; procedures; psychosis; schizophrenia","K.

In this study we sought to replicate the within-trial glutamate abnormality and to investigate the potential for structural differences and treatment-induced changes to improve identification of medication responders and non-responders. Methods: We enrolled 48 medication-naïve patients in a 4-week trial of risperidone and classified them retrospectively into responders and non-responders using clinical criteria. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and T1-weighted structural MRI were acquired pre- and post-treatment to quantify striatal glutamate levels and several measures of subcortical brain structure. Results: Patients were classified as 29 responders and 19 non-responders. Striatal glutamate was higher in the non-responders than responders both pre- and post-treatment (F1,39 = 7.15, p =.01). Volumetric measures showed a significant group x time interaction (t = 5.163, <1%FDR), and group x time x glutamate interaction (t = 4.23, <15%FDR) were seen in several brain regions. Striatal volumes increased at trend level with treatment in both groups, and a positive association of striatal volumes with glutamate levels was seen in the non-responders. Conclusions: Combining anatomic measures with glutamate levels offers the potential to enhance classification of responders and non-responders to antipsychotic medications as well as to provide mechanistic understanding of the interplay between neuroanatomical and neurochemical changes induced by these medications.

Detecting AD in all its presymptomatic and symptomatic stages is crucial for early intervention and treatment. An active research direction is to explore machine learning methods that harness multimodal data fusion to outperform human inspection of medical scans. However, existing multimodal fusion models have limitations, including redundant computation, complex architecture, and simplistic handling of missing data. Moreover, the preprocessing pipelines of medical scans remain inadequately detailed and are seldom optimized for individual subjects. In this paper, we propose an efficient early-late fusion (ELF) approach, which leverages a convolutional neural network for automated feature extraction and random forests for their competitive performance on small datasets. Additionally, we introduce a robust preprocessing pipeline that adapts to the unique characteristics of individual subjects and makes use of whole brain images rather than slices or patches. Moreover, to tackle the challenge of detecting subtle changes in brain volume, we transform images into the Jacobian domain (JD) to enhance both accuracy and robustness in our classification. Using MRI and CT images from the OASIS-3 dataset, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the ELF approach in classifying AD into four stages with an accuracy of 97.19%. © 2023 IEEE.","Alzheimer's disease; brain extraction tool (BET); computed tomography (CT); hot deck imputation (HDI); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); mild cognitive impairment (MCI)","Brain mapping; Classification (of information); Computerized tomography; Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Diagnosis; Extraction; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Neurodegenerative diseases; Pipelines; Alzheimers disease; Brain extraction tool; Brain extraction tools; Cognitive impairment; Computed tomography; Hot deck imputation; Hot-deck imputations; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mild cognitive impairment; Multimodal data fusion; Magnetic resonance imaging","T.

METHODS: We examined plasma biomarkers (neurofilament light chain, glial fibrillary acidic protein, amyloid beta [Aβ] 42/40, phosphorylated tau 181) and neuroimaging measures of amyloid deposition (Aβ-positron emission tomography [PET]), total brain volume, white matter hyperintensity volume, diffusion-weighted fractional anisotropy, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging free water. Participants were adjudicated as cognitively unimpaired (CU; N = 299), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N = 192), or dementia (DEM; N = 65). Biomarkers were compared across groups stratified by diagnosis, sex, race, and APOE ε4 carrier status. General linear models examined plasma-imaging associations before and after adjusting for demographics (age, sex, race, education), APOE ε4 status, medications, diagnosis, and other factors (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], body mass index [BMI]). RESULTS: Plasma biomarkers differed across diagnostic groups (DEM > MCI > CU), were altered in Aβ-PET-positive individuals, and were associated with poorer brain health and kidney function. DISCUSSION: eGFR and BMI did not substantially impact associations between plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers. Highlights: Plasma biomarkers differ across diagnostic groups (DEM > MCI > CU) and are altered in Aβ-PET-positive individuals. Altered plasma biomarker levels are associated with poorer brain health and kidney function. Plasma and neuroimaging biomarker associations are largely independent of comorbidities. © 2024 The Authors.

The objective of this work was to investigate fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI biomarkers and their ability to differentiate between sMCI and cMCI subjects in cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Three types of biomarkers were investigated: volume, intensity and texture. Volume biomarkers included total brain volume, cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSF), lateral ventricular volume, white matter lesion volume, subarachnoid CSF, and grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM), all normalized to intracranial volume. The mean intensity, kurtosis, and skewness of the GM and WM made up the intensity features. Texture features quantified homogeneity and microstructural tissue changes of GM and WM regions. Composite indices were also considered, which are biomarkers that represent an aggregate sum (z-score normalization and summation) of all biomarkers. The FLAIR MRI biomarkers successfully identified high-risk subjects as significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between the means of the sMCI and cMCI groups and the rate of change over time for several individual biomarkers as well as the composite indices for both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Classification accuracy and feature importance analysis showed volume biomarkers to be most predictive, however, best performance was obtained when complimenting the volume biomarkers with the intensity and texture features. Using all the biomarkers, accuracy of 86.2 % and 69.2 % was achieved for normal control-AD and sMCI-cMCI classification respectively. Survival analysis demonstrated that the majority of the biomarkers showed a noticeable impact on the AD conversion probability 4 years prior to conversion. Composite indices were the top performers for all analyses including feature importance, classification, and survival analysis. This demonstrated their ability to summarize various dimensions of disease into single-valued metrics. Significant correlation (p < 0.05) with phosphorylated-tau and amyloid-beta CSF biomarkers was found with all the FLAIR biomarkers. The proposed biomarker system is easily attained as FLAIR is routinely acquired, models are not computationally intensive and the results are explainable, thus making this pipeline easily integrated into clinical workflow. © 2023","Alzheimer's disease; Biomarkers; FLAIR MRI; Mild cognitive impairment","Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Progression; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Peptide Fragments; tau Proteins; amyloid beta protein; tau protein; amyloid beta protein; biological marker; peptide fragment; tau protein; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain lateral ventricle; brain size; cerebrospinal fluid; classifier; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diagnostic accuracy; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging; gray matter volume; high risk population; human; lesion volume; longitudinal study; major clinical study; mild cognitive impairment; protein phosphorylation; subarachnoid space; survival; white matter; white matter lesion; Alzheimer disease; cognitive defect; disease exacerbation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures","O.

Alterations characterize it in the brain, leading to specific proteins' deposition. Alzheimer's disease produces a reduction in brain volume, which eventually leads to brain cell death. More than 70% are 75 years of age or older. Alzheimer's disease is estimated to impact 60-70 percent of the world's 55 million dementia patients. Researchers have uncovered many elements that may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease. Machine learning techniques have the potential to improve the diagnosis method for Alzheimer's disease dramatically. Deep learning algorithms have seen a lot of success in the field of medical image analysis in recent years. Yet, there has been little study into the use of deep learning algorithms for detecting and categorizing Alzheimer's disease. This paper presents a deep-learning model for identifying and classifying different types of Alzheimer's disease using brain MRI data. The data collection contains a total of 6400 photographs. There are 1279 photographs used for training and 5121 for testing purposes; in this case, data augmentation is also employed to diversify the dataset. A CNN-based transfer learning model named Inception V3 is used to create results in this work, and the outcomes are compared based on precision, recall, F1-Score, and accuracy. The model's total accuracy is 89%. The use of categorization in predicting Alzheimer's disease is precious to medical experts involved in the condition's treatment.  © 2023 IEEE.","Alzheimer; brain cells; Brain Images; Deep learning; Image Classification; Inception V3; MRI; Transfer learning","Brain; Brain mapping; Cell death; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Photography; Statistical tests; Alzheimer; Alzheimers disease; Brain cells; Brain images; Deep learning; Images classification; Inception v3; Learning models; Risk levels; Transfer learning; Image classification","R.

Objective: To evaluate the association between handgrip strength (HGS) and dementia, reduced cognition, and poorer neuroimaging outcomes in a UK population of middle-aged adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study evaluated UK Biobank participants aged 39 to 73 years enrolled from 2006 to 2010 with measured HGS and prospectively followed up for dementia diagnosis. Data were analyzed from October 2021 to April 2022. Exposures: HGS assessed in both hands via dynamometer. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included cognitive test scores (fluid intelligence and prospective memory), brain magnetic resonance imaging measures (total brain volume, white matter hyperintensity, and hippocampal volume), and incident dementia (all-cause, vascular, and Alzheimer disease [AD] from primary care, hospital, or death records) over a median (IQR) of 11.7 (11.0-12.4) years of follow-up. Mixed-effects linear and logistic regressions and Cox proportional-hazard models were used to estimate associations, stratified by gender and adjusted for covariates. Estimates are presented per 5-kg decrement in HGS. To evaluate reverse causation, we assessed whether a polygenic risk score for AD is associated with HGS. Results: A subsample of 190406 adult participants in the UK Biobank (mean [SD] age, 56.5 [8.1] years; 102735 women [54%]) were evaluated. A 5-kg decrement in HGS was associated with lower fluid intelligence scores in men (β, -0.007; 95% CI, -0.010 to -0.003) and women (β, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.05 to -0.04. A 5-kg decrement in HGS was associated with worse odds of correctly responding to a prospective memory task for men (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.90 to 0.92) and women (odds ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.90). A 5-kg decrement in HGS was associated with greater white matter hyperintensity volume in men (β, 92.22; 95% CI, 31.09 to 153.35) and women (β, 83.56; 95% CI, 13.54 to 153.58). A 5-kg decrement in HGS was associated with incident dementia for men (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.28) and women (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.26). The AD genetic risk score was not significantly associated with HGS. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that HGS is associated with measures of neurocognitive brain health among men and women and they add to a growing body of research indicating that interventions designed to increase muscle strength, particularly among middle-aged adults, may hold promise for the maintenance of neurocognitive brain health. © 2022 American Medical Association.

Among the tools that implement automated brain volumetry, AccuBrain has been validated for its accuracy, reliability and clinical applications for the older version (IV1.2). Here, we aim to investigate the performance of an updated version (IV2.0) of AccuBrain for future use from several aspects. Methods: Public datasets with 3D T1-weighted scans were included for version comparisons, each with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and normal control (NC) subjects that were matched in age and gender. For the comparisons of the brain volumetric measures quantified from the same scans, we investigated the difference of hippocampal segmentation accuracy (using Dice similarity coefficient [DSC] as the major measurement). As AccuBrain generates a composite index (AD resemblance atrophy index, AD-RAI) that indicates similarity with AD-like brain atrophy pattern, we also compared the two versions for the diagnostic accuracy of AD versus NC with AD-RAI. Also, we examined the intra-scanner reproducibility of the two versions for the scans acquired with short-intervals using intraclass correlation coefficient. Results: AccuBrain IV2.0 presented significantly higher accuracy of hippocampal segmentation (DSC: 0.91 vs. 0.89, p < 0.001) and diagnostic accuracy of AD (AUC: 0.977 vs. 0.921, p < 0.001) than IV1.2. The results of intra-scanner reproducibility did not favor one version over the other. Conclusions: AccuBrain IV2.0 presented better segmentation accuracy and diagnostic accuracy of AD, and similar intra-scanner reproducibility compared with IV1.2. Both versions should be feasible for use due to the small magnitude of differences. © 2022, The Author(s).","AccuBrain; Accuracy; Automated brain volumetry; Reproducibility; Version comparison","Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Brain; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Alzheimer disease; atrophy; brain; diagnostic imaging; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures; reproducibility","L.

The amyloid cascade hypothesis (ACH) implies a sequence across ATN groups that patients might undergo during transition from healthy towards AD: A−T−N−➔A+T−N−➔A+T+N−➔A+T+N+. Here we assess the evidence for monotonic brain volume decline for this particular (amyloid-conversion first, tau-conversion second, N-conversion last) and alternative progressions using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in a large cross-sectional MRI cohort. Methods: We used baseline data of the DELCODE cohort of 437 subjects (127 controls, 168 SCD, 87 MCI, 55 AD patients) which underwent lumbar puncture, MRI scanning, and neuropsychological assessment. ATN classification was performed using CSF-Aβ42/Aβ40 (A+/−), CSF phospho-tau (T+/−), and adjusted hippocampal volume or CSF total-tau (N+/−). We compared voxel-wise model evidence for monotonic decline of gray matter volume across various sequences over ATN groups using the Bayesian Information Criterion (including also ROIs of Braak stages). First, face validity of the ACH transition sequence A−T−N−➔A+T−N−➔A+T+N−➔A+T+N+ was compared against biologically less plausible (permuted) sequences among AD continuum ATN groups. Second, we evaluated evidence for 6 monotonic brain volume progressions from A−T−N− towards A+T+N+ including also non-AD continuum ATN groups. Results: The ACH-based progression A−T−N−➔A+T−N−➔A+T+N−➔A+T+N+ was consistent with cognitive decline and clinical diagnosis. Using hippocampal volume for operationalization of neurodegeneration (N), ACH was most evident in 9% of gray matter predominantly in the medial temporal lobe. Many cortical regions suggested alternative non-monotonic volume progressions over ACH progression groups, which is compatible with an early amyloid-related tissue expansion or sampling effects, e.g., due to brain reserve. Volume decline in 65% of gray matter was consistent with a progression where A status converts before T or N status (i.e., ACH/ANT) when compared to alternative sequences (TAN/TNA/NAT/NTA). Brain regions earlier affected by tau tangle deposition (Braak stage I-IV, MTL, limbic system) present stronger evidence for volume decline than late Braak stage ROIs (V/VI, cortical regions). Similar findings were observed when using CSF total-tau for N instead. Conclusion: Using the ATN classification system, early amyloid status conversion (before tau and neurodegeneration) is associated with brain volume loss observed during AD progression. The ATN system and the ACH are compatible with monotonic progression of MTL atrophy.

We related self-reported liver disease to longitudinal measures of brain structure and cognition, as well as baseline measures of plasma AD/neurodegeneration biomarkers in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Liver disease was identified using ICD-9 classification codes. Brain volume and cognition were assessed serially using 3T-MRI and a cognitive battery. 1008, 2157, and 780 participants were included in the MRI, cognitive, and plasma biomarker analysis, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, liver disease was associated with accelerated decline in total brain and white matter volume, but not total gray matter or AD signature region volume. Although liver disease showed no relationship with domain-specific cognitive decline or plasma biomarkers, participants with a history of hepatitis demonstrated accelerated decline in verbal fluency and elevated neurofilament light. Results suggest all-cause liver disease may accelerate brain volume loss but does not appear to promote AD-specific neurocognitive changes. © 2022","AD plasma biomarkers; Alzheimer's disease; Cognitive assessment; Liver disease; Longitudinal study; MRI","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Humans; Liver Diseases; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neurodegenerative Diseases; amyloid beta protein; biological marker; adult; aging; Alzheimer disease; Article; attention; autoimmune liver disease; brain function; brain size; central nervous system function; cognition; cognitive defect; cognitive function test; cohort analysis; degenerative disease; depth perception; executive function; executive function test; female; figural fluency test; hepatic encephalopathy; hepatitis; hippocampus; human; liver cirrhosis; liver disease; longitudinal study; male; neurofilament; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; questionnaire; verbal memory; aged; Alzheimer disease; brain; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; psychology","K.A.

Background: Surrogate biomarkers of disease progression are a major unmet need in MSA. Small-scale longitudinal studies in patients with MSA using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess progression of brain atrophy have produced inconsistent results. In recent years, novel MRI post-processing methods have been developed enabling reliable quantification of brain atrophy in an automated fashion. Methods: Serial 3D-T1-weighted MRI assessments (baseline and after 1 year of follow-up) of 43 patients with MSA were analyzed and compared to a cohort of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy controls (HC). FreeSurfer's longitudinal analysis stream was used to determine the brain atrophy rates in an observer-independent fashion. Results: Mean ages at baseline were 64.4 ± 8.3, 60.0 ± 7.5, and 59.8 ± 9.2 years in MSA, PD patients and HC, respectively. A mean disease duration at baseline of 4.1 ± 2.5 years in MSA patients and 2.3 ± 1.4 years in PD patients was observed. Brain regions chiefly affected by MSA pathology showed progressive atrophy with annual rates of atrophy for the cerebellar cortex, cerebellar white matter, pons, and putamen of −4.24 ± 6.8%, −8.22 ± 8.8%, −4.67 ± 4.9%, and − 4.25 ± 4.9%, respectively. Similar to HC, atrophy rates in PD patients were minimal with values of −0.41% ± 1.8%, −1.47% ± 4.1%, −0.04% ± 1.8%, and −1.54% ± 2.2% for cerebellar cortex, cerebellar white matter, pons, and putamen, respectively. Conclusions: Patients with MSA show significant brain volume loss over 12 months, and cerebellar, pontine, and putaminal volumes were the most sensitive to change in mid-stage disease. © 2023 The Authors.

The mammillary bodies are important for both complex memory formation and anxiety and are implicated in several neurological disorders that present with memory impairments. However, little is known about their role in schizophrenia. Post-mortem studies have reported a loss of neurons in the mammillary bodies but there are also reports of increased mammillary body volume. The findings from in vivo MRI studies have also been mixed, but studies have typically only involved small sample sizes. To address this, we acquired mammillary body volumes from the open-source COBRE dataset, where we were able to manually measure the mammillary bodies in 72 individuals with a schizophrenia diagnosis and 74 controls. Participant age ranged from 18 to 65. We found the mammillary bodies to be smaller in the patient group, across both hemispheres, after accounting for the effects of total brain volume and gender. Hippocampal volumes, but not subiculum or total grey matter volumes, were also significantly lower in patients. Given the importance of the mammillary bodies for both memory and anxiety, this atrophy could contribute to the symptomology in schizophrenia. © 2023, The Author(s).","","adult; anxiety disorder; Article; autopsy; body volume; brain atrophy; brain size; controlled study; female; gray matter; hemisphere; hippocampus; human; in vivo study; left hemisphere; limbic cortex; major clinical study; male; mammillary body; medial temporal lobe; memory; memory disorder; nerve cell; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; right hippocampus; sample size; schizophrenia; subiculum","S.D.

Here, we examined the association of stage 1 vs. stage 2 with structural brain reserve in memory-related brain regions. Methods: We tested whether the volumes of hippocampal subfields and parahippocampal regions were larger in individuals at stage 1 compared to asymptomatic amyloid-negative older adults (healthy controls, HCs). We also tested whether individuals with stage 2 would show the opposite pattern, namely smaller brain volumes than in amyloid-negative individuals with SCD. Participants with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker data and bilateral volumetric MRI data from the observational, multi-centric DZNE-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE) study were included. The sample comprised 95 amyloid-negative and 26 amyloid-positive asymptomatic participants as well as 104 amyloid-negative and 47 amyloid-positive individuals with SCD. Volumes were based on high-resolution T2-weighted images and automatic segmentation with manual correction according to a recently established high-resolution segmentation protocol. Results: In asymptomatic individuals, brain volumes of hippocampal subfields and of the parahippocampal cortex were numerically larger in stage 1 compared to HCs, whereas the opposite was the case in individuals with SCD. MANOVAs with volumes as dependent data and age, sex, years of education, and DELCODE site as covariates showed a significant interaction between diagnosis (asymptomatic versus SCD) and amyloid status (Aß42/40 negative versus positive) for hippocampal subfields. Post hoc paired comparisons taking into account the same covariates showed that dentate gyrus and CA1 volumes in SCD were significantly smaller in amyloid-positive than negative individuals. In contrast, CA1 volumes were significantly (p = 0.014) larger in stage 1 compared with HCs. Conclusions: These data indicate that HCs and stages 1 and 2 do not correspond to linear brain volume reduction. Instead, stage 1 is associated with larger than expected volumes of hippocampal subfields in the face of amyloid pathology. This indicates a brain reserve mechanism in stage 1 that enables individuals with amyloid pathologic change to be cognitively normal and asymptomatic without subjective cognitive decline. © 2023, The Author(s).","Alzheimer’s disease (AD); Amyloid pathologic change; Aß42/40; Brain reserve; Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); Hippocampus; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Medial temporal lobe; Memory; Subjective cognitive decline (SCD)","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Cerebral Cortex; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cognitive Reserve; Humans; amyloid beta protein[1-40]; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; amyloid protein; age distribution; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; asymptomatic disease; brain size; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; cognitive defect; cognitive reserve; controlled study; dentate gyrus; disease classification; disease course; educational status; female; hippocampal CA1 region; hippocampus; human; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis of variance; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parahippocampal gyrus; sex difference; subjective cognitive decline; Alzheimer disease; brain cortex; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging","Z.

This review has as the main objective to summarize the main structural changes, evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging, reported in patients with first psychotic episode. Methods: We made a systematic review, including articles published during the last 5 years, reporting findings in magnetic resonance imaging, in patients with a first psychotic episode. We analyzed and compared the findings in cortical and subcortical brain structures. Results: From a total of 6,882 articles, we review 59. Reports included five categories: schizophrenia, schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar affective disorder, affective spectrum, and toxic psychosis. In schizophrenia, there were greater alterations in cerebral cortex, at level of anterior cingulate, parahippocampus, and insula. Regarding hippocampus, there was more decrease in CA1, while in thalamus there was a marked decrease in anterior nuclei, and in basal ganglia there was a decrease in striatum and caudate, and increase in putamen. In affective disorders, changes are located in temporal lobe, and in toxic psychosis, there was an increase in putamen and thalamus. Conclusions: We described structural brain changes, cortical and subcortical, in patients with a first psychotic episode. These changes could be differential markers, so it is important to make studies with more patients, and make a follow up to determine if these changes are present after the diagnosis is established. © 2023 Asociación Colombiana de Psiquiatría","Brain MRI; Brain volumes; Cerebral cortex; First psychotic episode; Subcortical structures","","J.C.

In the United States, an astounding 9% of all boys and 4% of girls will be prescribed stimulant drugs at some point during their childhood. Recent meta-analyses have revealed that individuals with ADHD have reduced brain volume loss later in life (>60 y.o.) compared to the normal aging brain, which suggests that either ADHD or its treatment may be neuroprotective. Crucially, these neuroprotective effects were significant in brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala) where severe volume loss is linked to cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. Historically, the ADHD diagnosis and its pharmacotherapy came about nearly simultaneously, making it difficult to evaluate their effects in isolation. Certain evidence suggests that psychostimulants may normalize structural brain changes typically observed in the ADHD brain. If ADHD itself is neuroprotective, perhaps exercising the brain, then psychostimulants may not be recommended across the lifespan. Alternatively, if stimulant drugs are neuroprotective, then this class of medications may warrant further investigation for their therapeutic effects. Here, we take a bottom-up holistic approach to review the psychopharmacology of ADHD in the context of recent models of attention. We suggest that future studies are greatly needed to better appreciate the interactions amongst an ADHD diagnosis, stimulant treatment across the lifespan, and structure-function alterations in the aging brain.

Deep Neural Networks, Ordinal Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were employed to determine the 4 different ordinal levels of AD. Although there were similarities between the accuracy rate, F1 score, AUC value, and sensitivity, specificity, and precision performance measures of each class, the highest classification rate was achieved by the Random Forest model where the oversampling was not applied. (F1 score: 0.86; accuracy: 0.86 and AUC: 0.95). The outputs of the model with the best performance were explained with the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method.

Here, we evaluate amy-PET uptake in WM lesions (WML) and in the normal-appearing WM (NAWM) of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and non-AD type of dementia. Methods: Thirty-three cognitively impaired subjects underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Aβ1-42 (Aβ) determination in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and amy-PET. Twenty-three patients exhibiting concordant results in both CSF analysis and amy-PET for cortical amyloid deposition were recruited and divided into two groups, amyloid positive (A+) and negative (A−). WML quantification and brain volumes’ segmentation were performed. Standardized uptake values ratios (SUVR) were calculated in the grey matter (GM), NAWM and WML on amy-PET coregistered to MRI images. Results: A+ compared to A− showed a higher WML load (p = 0.049) alongside higher SUVR in all brain tissues (p < 0.01). No correlations between CSF Aβ levels and WML and NAWM SUVR were found in A+, while, in A−, CSF Aβ levels were directly correlated to NAWM SUVR (p = 0.04). CSF Aβ concentration was the only predictor of NAWM SUVR (adj R2 = 0.91; p = 0.04) in A−. In A+ but not in A− direct correlations were identified between WM and GM SUVR (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our data provide evidence on the role of amy-PET in the assessment of microstructural WM injury in non-AD dementia, whereas amy-PET seems less suitable to assess WM damage in AD patients due to a plausible amyloid accrual therein. © 2022, The Author(s).","Alzheimer’s disease; amy-PET; Amyloid; Non-AD dementias; White matter","Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Aniline Compounds; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; White Matter; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; biological marker; florbetapir f 18; amyloid; amyloid beta protein; aniline derivative; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain size; cerebellum; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; female; frontal lobe; frontotemporal dementia; gray matter; human; human tissue; image analysis; image processing; image reconstruction; image segmentation; Italy; lumbar puncture; male; Mini Mental State Examination; neuroimaging; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; posterior cingulate; precuneus; standardized uptake value ratio; superior parietal lobule; temporal lobe; three-dimensional imaging; white matter lesion; Alzheimer disease; cerebrospinal fluid; diagnostic imaging; metabolism; positron emission tomography; procedures; white matter","A.M.

Previous studies suggested that volumetric analysis plays a crucial role in various stages of dementia classification. In this study, volumetry, radiomics and demographics were integrated as inputs to develop an artificial intelligence model for various stages, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), mild cognitive decline (MCI) and cognitive normal (CN) dementia classifications. Method: The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset was separated into training and testing groups, and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset was used as the second testing group. The MRI MPRAGE image was reoriented via statistical parametric mapping (SPM12). Freesurfer was employed for brain segmentation, and 45 regional brain volumes were retrieved. The 3D Slicer software was employed for 107 radiomics feature extractions from within the whole brain. Data on patient demographics were collected from the datasets. The feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and the other most common artificial intelligence algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM), ensemble classifier (EC) and decision tree (DT), were used to build the models using various features. Results: The integration of brain regional volumes, radiomics and patient demographics attained the highest overall accuracy at 76.57% and 73.14% in ADNI and OASIS testing, respectively. The subclass accuracies in MCI, AD and CN were 78.29%, 89.71% and 85.14%, respectively, in ADNI testing, as well as 74.86%, 88% and 83.43% in OASIS testing. Balanced sensitivity and specificity were obtained for all subclass classifications in MCI, AD and CN. Conclusion: The FFNN yielded good overall accuracy for MCI, AD and CN categorization, with balanced subclass accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The proposed FFNN model is simple, and it may support the triage of patients for further confirmation of the diagnosis. © 2024 by the authors.","Alzheimer’s disease; artificial neural network; dementia; feed forward neural network; mild cognitive impairment; radiomics; volumetry","","E.Y.W.

Detecting AD in its preliminary stages before clinical manifestations is crucial for timely treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides valuable insights into brain abnormalities by measuring the decrease in brain volume expressly in the mesial temporal cortex and other regions of the brain, while Positron Emission Tomography (PET) measures the decrease of glucose concentration in the temporoparietal association cortex. When these data are combined, the performance of AD diagnostic methods could be improved. However, these data are heterogeneous and there is a need for an effective model that will harness the information from both data for the accurate prediction of AD. Methods: To this end, we present a novel heuristic early feature fusion framework that performs the concatenation of PET and MRI images, while a modified Resnet18 deep learning architecture is trained simultaneously on the two datasets. The innovative 3-in-channel approach is used to learn the most descriptive features of fused PET and MRI images for effective binary classification of AD. Results: The experimental results show that the proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of 73.90% on the ADNI database. Then, we provide an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) model, allowing us to explain the results. Conclusion: Our proposed model could learn latent representations of multimodal data even in the presence of heterogeneity data; hence, the proposed model partially solved the issue with the heterogeneity of the MRI and PET data. © 2023, The Author(s).","Alzheimer’s disease; Deep learning; Feature fusion; Heuristic methods; MRI; PET","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Diagnosis; Heuristic methods; Image fusion; Positron emission tomography; Alzheimer; Alzheimer’s disease; Brain abnormalities; Clinical manifestation; Cortexes; Deep learning; Features fusions; Human brain; Learn+; Multimodal input fusion; Alzheimer disease; Article; artificial intelligence; clinical feature; controlled study; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic procedure; disease classification; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; residual neural network; Magnetic resonance imaging","R.

Some studies have tried to improve the 'MCI due to Alzheimer's disease (AD)' classification by further stratifying these patients into subgroups. Depression-related symptoms may play an important role in helping to better define the MCI stage in elderly individuals. Objective: In this work, we explored functional and structural differences in the brains of patients with nondepressed MCI (nDMCI) and patients with MCI with depressive symptoms (DMCI), and we examined how these groups relate to AD atrophy patterns and cognitive functioning. Methods: Sixty-five participants underwent MRI exams and were divided into four groups: cognitively normal, nDMCI, DMCI, and AD. We compared the regional brain volumes, cortical thickness, and white matter microstructure measures using diffusion tensor imaging among groups. Additionally, we evaluated changes in functional connectivity using fMRI data. Results: In comparison to the nDMCI group, the DMCI patients had more pronounced atrophy in the hippocampus and amygdala. Additionally, DMCI patients had asymmetric damage in the limbic-frontal white matter connection. Furthermore, two medial posterior regions, the isthmus of cingulate gyrus and especially the lingual gyrus, had high importance in the structural and functional differentiation between the two groups. Conclusion: It is possible to differentiate nDMCI from DMCI patients using MRI techniques, which may contribute to a better characterization of subtypes of the MCI stage.  © 2023 The Author(s).

In response to this challenge, most countries have committed to conducting more research to overcome these challenges, including improving timely diagnosis. The final outcome of this system can determine the clinical stage of individuals with different levels of dementia, such as non-demented, moderately demented, mild demented, and very mild demented, by analyzing brain MRI scans of dementia patients. It also aims to determine the clinical dementia rating based on background data such as age, years of education, socioeconomic status, MMSE score, estimated total intracranial volume, normalized whole brain volume, and atlas scaling factor. Additionally, the system can identify brain tumors when MRI scans are included. Apart from the dementia field, the system is capable of detecting pneumonia using chest X-rays, although it is generally a rare condition. Unfortunately, aspiration pneumonia is more common in people with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. The ultimate goal of this research project is to develop a web-based system that enables healthcare professionals to determine the clinical stage of dementia patients while also facilitating the detection of brain tumors and pneumonia utilizing computer science and technology. © 2023 IEEE.","Alzheimer's Disease; Brain Tumor; Computer Science; Deep Learning; Dementia; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Pneumonia","Brain; Clinical research; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Medical computing; Neurodegenerative diseases; Tumors; Alzheimers disease; Assistive system; Brain tumors; Cognitive impairment; Deep learning; Dementia; Dementia patients; Mild cognitive impairment; MRI scan; Pneumonia; Magnetic resonance imaging","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","979-835032363-4","","","English","IEEE Int.

Positron emission tomography (PET) with 11C-UCB-J, a radioligand for the brain-wide presynaptic marker synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), detects more widespread brain changes in early HD than volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18F-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET, but longitudinal 11C-UCB-J PET data have not been reported. The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity of 11C-UCB-J PET, 18F-FDG PET, and volumetric MRI for detection of longitudinal changes in early HD. Methods: Seventeen HD mutation carriers (six premanifest and 11 early manifest) and 13 healthy controls underwent 11C-UCB-J PET, 18F-FDG PET, and volumetric MRI at baseline (BL) and after 21.4 ± 2.7 months (Y2). Within-group and between-group longitudinal clinical and imaging changes were assessed. Results: The HD group showed significant 2-year worsening of Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale motor scores. There was significant longitudinal volume loss within the HD group in caudate (−4.5% ± 3.8%), putamen (−3.6% ± 3.5%), pallidum (−3.0% ± 2.7%), and frontal cortex (−2.0% ± 2.1%) (all P < 0.001). Within the HD group there was longitudinal loss of putaminal SV2A binding (6.4% ± 8.8%, P = 0.01) and putaminal glucose metabolism (−2.8% ± 4.4%, P = 0.008), but these changes were not significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Premanifest subjects at BL only had significantly lower SV2A binding than controls in basal ganglia structures, but at Y2 additionally had significant SV2A loss in frontal and parietal cortex, indicating spread of SV2A loss from subcortical to cortical regions. Conclusions: Volumetric MRI may be more sensitive than 11C-UCB-J PET and 18F-FDG PET for detection of 2-year brain changes in early HD. © 2023 The Authors.

This study aimed to investigate whether masticatory function is associated with the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Methods: Data were obtained from the nationwide prospective cohort study of randomly sampled community-dwelling Koreans aged ≥ 60 years. The 5,064 non-demented participants, whose number of chewing cycles per bite was assessed by clinical interview, were followed for 8 years with biennial assessments of cognitive performance and clinical diagnoses of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging was collected from a subset of cohort participants and their spouses for imaging analyses. Results: Males who chewed ≥ 30 cycles/bite had faster decline in global cognition and memory function and were at higher risk for incident all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 2.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18–7.18) and AD (HR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.14–9.11) compared to males with less than 10 cycles/bite. Additionally, increased chewing cycles in males were associated with reduced brain volume, particularly in regions involved in compensatory cognitive control of mastication. There was no significant association between chewing cycles and the risk of dementia or brain volume in females. Conclusion: Older men who frequently chew their meals could be considered a notable population at risk for dementia who should be carefully assessed for their cognitive trajectories. © 2024 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.","Brain-Stomatognathic System; Cognitive Decline; Dementia; Masticatory Function; Sex Difference","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cohort Studies; Dementia; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mastication; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; aged; Alzheimer disease; brain; cognition; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; dementia; diagnostic imaging; female; human; male; mastication; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; physiology; proportional hazards model; prospective study; risk factor; sex factor; very elderly","K.W.

For this system, T1-weighted, three-dimensional brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) for five different groups of subjects were obtained from Alz-heimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) databases. In this research work the VolBrain-an automated MRI brain volumetry system has been used for Segmenting the region of interest (ROI). Ten volumetric features which are prone to AD phase has been selected and used for the classification of different stages of AD using Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). In this system, the Three Grade classifier, which classifies AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and the cognitively normal (CN) group of subjects and the Four Grade classifier, which classifies AD, late MCI (LMCI), early MCI (EMCI), and CN groups of subjects were developed. The performance of these methods has been validated using performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F-score. It has been found that ANFIS using subtractive clustering optimised with a hybrid algorithm performs better when compared with the other methods used in this system. © 2023, Scibulcom Ltd..

This study aimed to evaluate plasma LCN2 levels and explore their correlation with clinical and neuroimaging features in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure plasma LCN2 levels in 120 subjects. Evaluation of motor symptoms and nonmotor symptoms in PD patients was assessed by the associated scales. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to evaluate brain volume alterations, and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was used to quantitatively analyze brain iron deposition in 46 PD patients. Plasma LCN2 levels were significantly higher in PD patients than those in healthy controls. LCN2 levels were negatively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, total brain gray matter volume (GMV), and GMV/total intracranial volume (TIV) ratio, but positively correlated with Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMD) scores and mean QSM values of the bilateral substantial nigra (SN). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed that plasma LCN2 levels had good predictive accuracy for PD. The results suggest that plasma LCN2 levels have potential as a biomarker for the diagnosis of PD. LCN2 may be a therapeutic target for neuroinflammation and brain iron deposition. © 2024 The Authors.

The APOE ε4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for LOAD, with the ε4/ε4 genotype associated with the greatest atrophy rates. To date, there is limited hippocampal volume reporting in preclinical APOE models. To assess the translational potential of a humanized APOE (hAPOE) mouse model, we report age, sex, and genotype effects on total brain and hippocampal volume. Method: High resolution ex-vivo MRIs were obtained from two separate cohorts of male and female hAPOE mice (Cohort 1: n=53, 18.47±0.99 months; Cohort 2: n=33, 24.24±0.58 months). A validated mouse brain atlas was used for volumetric analysis. Cohorts were analyzed separately with genotype by sex analyses of variance for total brain volume (sum of all regions in atlas) as well as left and right hippocampal volume as percent of total brain volume. Result: In Cohort 1, hAPOEε4/ε4 mice had significantly larger brains than hAPOEε3/ε3s or hAPOEε3/ε4s, with female hAPOEε4/ε4s having the largest brains (p<0.001). Regardless of genotype, females had smaller left (p=0.006) and right (p<0.001) hippocampi relative to males. In Cohort 2, there were no genotype or sex differences in total brain volume. However, left (p=0.044) and right (p=0.034) hippocampal volumes were smaller for hAPOEε4/ε4 mice compared to hAPOEε3/ε4 mice without sex effects. Conclusion: Our findings capitalize on a large dataset (n=88) of high-resolution MRIs. At 18-20 months old (∼60 human years), hAPOEε4/ε4 mice had greater total brain volume than comparably aged hAPOEε3/ε3 or hAPOEε3/ε4 mice without hippocampal atrophy. However, hippocampal atrophy was evident when mice were aged to 24-25 months (∼70 human years). These findings of larger brain volume and greater hippocampal atrophy in hAPOEε4/ε4 carriers are consistent with large-scale AD imaging datasets. The timing of evident hippocampal atrophy in these mice also coincides with the global average age of clinical diagnosis. Based on these findings, the translational potential of this model requires utilizing very old mice, limiting the window for therapeutic testing. © 2022 the Alzheimer's Association.","","apolipoprotein E4; jax protein; protein; unclassified drug; aged; animal experiment; animal model; brain atrophy; brain size; cohort analysis; controlled study; ex vivo study; female; genotype; hippocampus; male; mouse; neuroimaging; nonhuman; Note; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; very elderly; volumetry","A.C.

In this study, we introduce an alternative transparent model using decision trees and propose a novel method for producing explainable predictions. Our approach involves processing MRI data by considering the percentage of brain regions as input to the decision tree, rather than traditional volumetric data. The resulting self-explanatory decision tree model transforms its binary tree graph into a rule-path shape, facilitating easy tracing of the generated tree's path. Our study demonstrates that the accuracy of decision trees can reach 97% using a region-percentage approach, which is an increase from the 71% accuracy obtained with the conventional volumetric approach. © 2024 IEEE.","Alzheimer's disease; brain volume region; decision tree; self-explanatory","Binary trees; Decision trees; Deep learning; Neurodegenerative diseases; Alzheimers disease; Brain regions; Brain volume; Brain volume region; Disease classification; Intelligence models; Interpretability; Model-based OPC; Self-explanatory; Volume estimations; Magnetic resonance imaging","C.-Y.

Fifty participants (11 cognitively unim-paired [CU], 10 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 29 with AD) who underwent18 F-florbetaben positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and neuropsychological tests were enrolled. The hippocampal subfield volumes were obtained using an automated brain volumetry system with the Winterburn atlas and were compared among the diagnostic groups, and the correlations with the Aβ deposition and AD risk factors were determined. Patients with MCI and AD showed decreased volume in the stratum radiatum/lacunosum/moleculare (SRLM) of the cornu ammonis (CA)1 and CA4-dentate gyrus (DG) compared with the CU. Decreased SRLM and CA4-DG volumes were associated with an increased Aβ deposition in the global cortex (R = −0.459, p = 0.001; R = −0.393, p = 0.005, respectively). The SRLM and CA4-DG volumes aided in the distinction of AD from CU (areas under the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC] curve = 0.994 and 0.981, respectively, p < 0.001), and Aβ+ from Aβ− individuals (AUROC curve = 0.949 and 0.958, respec-tively, p < 0.001).

CCD is frequently detected using positron emission tomography (PET). However, advanced MRI techniques have come forth for the detection of CCD. The correct diagnosis of CCD is crucial for the care of neurological patients and those with neurodegenerative conditions. The purpose of this study is to determine whether PET can offer extra value over MRI or an advanced technique in MRI for detecting CCD in neurological conditions. We searched three main electronic databases from 1980 until the present and included only English and peer-reviewed journal articles. Eight articles involving 1246 participants met the inclusion criteria, six of which used PET imaging while the other two used MRI and hybrid imaging. The findings in PET studies showed decreased cerebral metabolism in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices, as on the opposite side of the cerebellar cortex. However, the findings in MRI studies showed decreased cerebellar volumes. This study concludes that PET is a common, accurate, and sensitive technique for detecting both crossed cerebellar and uncrossed basal ganglia as well as thalamic diaschisis in neurodegenerative diseases, while MRI is better for measuring brain volume. This study suggests that PET has a higher diagnostic value for diagnosing CCD compared to MRI, and that PET is a more valuable technique for predicting CCD. © 2023 by the authors.","dementia and related disorders; neurodegenerative disorders; neuroimaging; nuclear medicine; Parkinson disease and related disorders","flortaucipir f 18; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; oxygen 15; Pittsburgh compound B; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; basal ganglion; bibliographic database; brain metabolism; brain size; cerebellum; cerebellum cortex; cerebellum disease; crossed cerebellar diaschisis; degenerative disease; dementia; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; diaschisis; Embase; female; frontal cortex; human; male; Medline; meta analysis; neuroimaging; neurologic disease; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occipital cortex; parietal cortex; Parkinson disease; positron emission tomography; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; quality control; Review; Scopus; single photon emission computed tomography; systematic review; temporal cortex; thalamus","N.A.

Methods: We followed 1158 dementia-free Japanese residents aged ≥65 years for 5.0 years. Regional grey matter volume (GMV) at baseline was estimated by applying voxel-based morphometry methods. The GMV-to- total brain volume ratio (GMV/TBV) was calculated, and its association with dementia risk was estimated using Cox proportional hazard models. We assessed whether the predictive ability of a model based on known dementia risk factors could be improved by adding the total number of regions with grey matter atrophy among dementia-related brain regions, where the cut-off value for grey matter atrophy in each region was determined by receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: During the follow-up, 113 participants developed all-cause dementia, including 83 with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lower GMV/TBV of the medial temporal lobe, insula, hippocampus and amygdala were significantly/marginally associated with higher risk of all-cause dementia and AD (all p for trend ≤0.08). The risks of all-cause dementia and AD increased significantly with increasing total number of brain regions exhibiting grey matter atrophy (both p for trend <0.01). Adding the total number of regions with grey matter atrophy into a model consisting of known risk factors significantly improved the predictive ability for AD (Harrell's c-statistics: 0.765.0.802; p=0.02). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the total number of regions with grey matter atrophy among the medial temporal lobe, insula, hippocampus and amygdala is a significant predictor for developing dementia, especially AD, in the general older population.  © 2022 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).","","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Atrophy; Brain; Dementia; Female; Gray Matter; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; antihypertensive agent; cholesterol; glucose; aged; alcohol consumption; Alzheimer disease; amygdala; Article; blood pressure measurement; body height; body mass; body weight; brain atrophy; brain mapping; caudate nucleus; cerebrospinal fluid; cholesterol blood level; cingulate gyrus; cognition assessment; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; dementia; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; disease association; disease classification; DSM-III; electrocardiogram; entorhinal cortex; exercise; female; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging; globus pallidus; glucose blood level; gray matter volume; hippocampus; human; hypertension; image analysis; image artifact; image segmentation; insula; Japanese (people); lifestyle; longitudinal study; magnetic resonance angiography; major clinical study; male; medial temporal lobe; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; multiinfarct dementia; neuroimaging; neuropsychological assessment; nucleus accumbens; parahippocampal gyrus; predictive value; proportional hazards model; prospective study; putamen; receiver operating characteristic; risk factor; smoking; systolic blood pressure; T1 weighted imaging; T2 weighted imaging; thalamus; three-dimensional imaging; voxel based morphometry; Wechsler memory scale; white matter; atrophy; brain; complication; dementia; diagnostic imaging; gray matter; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; very elderly","T.

Alzheimer's is the most common cause for dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic disease with no cure, and it continues to pose a threat to millions of lives worldwide. The main purpose of this study is to detect the presence of AD from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans through neuro imaging and to perform fusion process of both MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) scans of the same patient to obtain a fused image with more detailed information. Detection of AD is done by calculating the gray matter and white matter volumes of the brain and subsequently, a ratio of calculated volume is taken which helps the doctors in deciding whether the patient is affected with or without the disease. Image fusion is carried out after preliminary detection of AD for MRI scan along with PET scan. The main objective is to combine these two images into a single image which contains all the possible information together. The proposed approach yields better results with a peak signal to noise ratio of 60.6 dB, mean square error of 0.0176, entropy of 4.6 and structural similarity index of 0.8. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Quantitative volumetric reporting tools (QReports) can improve the accuracy and objectivity of MRI-based assessments. Several QReports are commercially available; however, validation can be difficult to establish and does not currently follow a common pathway. To aid evidence-based clinical decision-making, we performed a systematic review of commercial QReports for use in MS including technical details and published reports of validation and in-use evaluation. Methods: We categorized studies into three types of testing: technical validation, for example, comparison to manual segmentation, clinical validation by clinicians or interpretation of results alongside clinician-rated variables, and in-use evaluation, such as health economic assessment. Results: We identified 10 companies, which provide MS lesion and brain segmentation and volume quantification, and 38 relevant publications. Tools received regulatory approval between 2006 and 2020, contextualize results to normative reference populations, ranging from 620 to 8000 subjects, and require T1- and T2-FLAIR-weighted input sequences for longitudinal assessment of whole-brain volume and lesions. In MS, six QReports provided evidence of technical validation, four companies have conducted clinical validation by correlating results with clinical variables, only one has tested their QReport by clinician end-users, and one has performed a simulated in-use socioeconomic evaluation. Conclusion: We conclude that there is limited evidence in the literature regarding clinical validation and in-use evaluation of commercial MS QReports with a particular lack of clinician end-user testing. Our systematic review provides clinicians and institutions with the available evidence when considering adopting a quantitative reporting tool for MS. © 2022, The Author(s).","MRI; Multiple sclerosis; Quantitative volumetric reporting tools; Systematic review; Validation","Brain; Clinical Decision-Making; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multiple Sclerosis; Alzheimer disease; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; brain atrophy; brain damage; brain size; cerebrospinal fluid; clinician; cognitive defect; comparative study; contrast to noise ratio; convolutional neural network; data base; data extraction; degenerative disease; dementia; digital imaging and communications in medicine; disease activity; eligibility; epilepsy; evaluation study; Expanded Disability Status Scale; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging; gray matter; health economics; human; image analysis; image quality; image segmentation; information retrieval; Medline; multiple sclerosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; peer review; physical disability; publication; Review; Scopus; signal noise ratio; symbol digit modalities test; systematic review; T1 weighted imaging; T2 weighted imaging; validation study; white matter; white matter lesion; brain; clinical decision making; cost benefit analysis; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures","Z.

Thus, detecting MCI at early stages is considered crucial but also challenging due to not only its subtle symptoms but also the need for safe and effective detection methods. In this matter, virtual reality (VR) environments can simulate real-world scenarios that challenge various cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and spatial awareness. Besides, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans offer detailed images of brain structures and can reveal changes in brain activity patterns associated with MCI. Electroencephalography (EEG) based approaches also offer a non-invasive and cost-effective means of detecting early-stage MCI by capturing changes in brain activity and connectivity patterns associated with cognitive decline. While EEG and MRI combined with VR simulations are valuable tools for predicting MCI, advancements in machine learning (ML) facilitate feature extraction from biomedical and physiological signals, particularly in anomaly detection and classification tasks. In this study, we present a novel method leveraging a multimodal model to differentiate MCI from healthy control (HC) subjects using multimodal data comprising EEG, MRI, and VR data.  © 2024 IEEE.","EEG; Machine Learning; MCI detection; MRI; Multimodality; VR","Anomaly detection; Brain; Brain mapping; Machine learning; Alzheimers disease; Brain activity patterns; Brain volume; Cognitive impairment; Detection methods; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Mild cognitive impairment detection; Multi-modal; Multi-modality; Neurodegenerative diseases","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","979-835037905-1","","","English","Int.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: 1Florida Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center baseline study. Participants: Two-hundred and twelve participants with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score above 16 and a broad array of cognitive diagnoses ranging from cognitively normal (CN) to dementia, of whom 58% were female, mean age of 72.1 (SD 7.9). Measures: Participants underwent extensive clinical and neuropsychological evaluations, MR and amyloid Positron Emission Tomography/Computer/Computer Tomography (PET/CT) imaging, and analyses of APOE ϵ4 genotype. Confirmatory path analyses were conducted in the structural equation modeling framework that estimated multiple equations simultaneously while controlling for important covariates such as sex, education, language of evaluation, and global cognitive impairment. Results: Both amyloid positivity and decreased brain volumes in AD-prone regions were directly related to LASSI-L Cued B1 and Cued B2 intrusions (sensitive to PSI and frPSI effects) even after controlling for covariates. APOE ϵ4 status did not evidence direct effects on these LASSI-L cognitive markers, but rather exerted their effects on amyloid positivity, which in turn related to PSI and frPSI. Similarly, age did not have a direct relationship with LASSI-L scores, but exerted its effects indirectly through amyloid positivity and volumes of AD-prone brain regions. Conclusions: Our study provides insight into the relationships among age, APOE ϵ4, amyloid, and brain volumetric reductions as it relates to semantic intrusion errors. The investigation expands our understanding of the underpinnings of PSI and frPSI intrusions in a large cohort. © International Psychogeriatric Association 2021.","amyloid; intrusion errors; Mild Cognitive Impairment; path analysis; preclinical Alzheimer’s disease; semantic interference; structural MRI","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoprotein E4; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Positron-Emission Tomography; Semantics; amyloid; apolipoprotein E4; amyloid; amyloid beta protein; apolipoprotein E4; adult; age; aged; Alzheimer disease; APOE4 gene; Article; brain region; brain size; clinical assessment; cognition assessment; cognitive stress; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease predisposition; female; genotype; human; learning test; Loewenstein Acevedo Scales of Semantic Interference and Learning; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; path analysis; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; semantic memory; structural equation modeling; volumetry; Alzheimer disease; brain; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; genetics; metabolism; positron emission tomography; semantics","D.A.

However, the association between digitally obtained clock drawing features and structural neuroimaging measures has not been assessed in large population-based studies. Objective: We aimed to investigate the association between dCDT features and brain volume. Methods: This study included participants from the Framingham Heart Study who had both a dCDT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and were free of dementia or stroke. Linear regression models were used to assess the association between 18 dCDT composite scores (derived from 105 dCDT raw features) and brain MRI measures, including total cerebral brain volume (TCBV), cerebral white matter volume, cerebral gray matter volume, hippocampal volume, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume. Classification models were also built from clinical risk factors, dCDT composite scores, and MRI measures to distinguish people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from those whose cognition was intact. Results: A total of 1656 participants were included in this study (mean age 61 years, SD 13 years; 50.9% women), with 23 participants diagnosed with MCI. All dCDT composite scores were associated with TCBV after adjusting for multiple testing (P value <.05/18). Eleven dCDT composite scores were associated with cerebral white matter volume, but only 1 dCDT composite score was associated with cerebral gray matter volume. None of the dCDT composite scores was associated with hippocampal volume or WMH volume. The classification model for differentiating MCI and normal cognition participants, which incorporated age, sex, education, MRI measures, and dCDT composite scores, showed an area under the curve of 0.897. Conclusions: dCDT composite scores were significantly associated with multiple brain MRI measures in a large community-based cohort. The dCDT has the potential to be used as a cognitive assessment tool in the clinical diagnosis of MCI. © Jing Yuan, Rhoda Au, Cody Karjadi, Ting Fang Ang, Sherral Devine, Sanford Auerbach, Charles DeCarli, David J Libon, Jesse Mez, Honghuang Lin.","Alzheimer; Boston Process Approach; Clock Drawing Test; cognitive; dementia; digital; Framingham Heart Study; neurology; neuropsychological test; technology","Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; abstract thinking; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; area under the curve; Article; Boston naming test; brain size; clinical feature; clock drawing test; cohort analysis; controlled study; dementia; executive function; female; Framingham risk score; gray matter volume; Hooper visual organization test; human; language; major clinical study; male; Massachusetts; mental performance; middle aged; mild cognitive impairment; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prospective study; quantitative analysis; trail making test; verbal memory; visual memory; white matter; brain; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; longitudinal study; pathology","H.

Aims To examine the association of overall cardiovascular risk burden with the risk of major dementia subtypes and volumes of related brain regions in a large sample, and to explore the role of genetics and CVD onset. Methods A prospective study among 354 654 participants free of CVD and dementia (2006–2010, mean age 56.4 years) was conducted within the UK Biobank, with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurement available for 15 104 participants since 2014. CVD risk burden was evaluated by the Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score (FGCRS). Dementia diagnosis was ascertained from inpatient and death register data. Results Over a median 12.0-year follow-up, 3998 all-cause dementia cases were identified. Higher FGCRS was associated with increased all-cause dementia risk after adjusting for demographic, major lifestyle, clinical factors and the polygenic risk score (PRS) of Alzheimer’s disease. Comparing the high versus low tertile of FGCRS, the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 1.26 (1.12 to 1.41) for all-cause dementia, 1.67 (1.33 to 2.09) for Alzheimer’s disease and 1.53 (1.07 to 2.16) for vascular dementia (all ptrend<0.05). Incident stroke and coronary heart disease accounted for 14% (95% CI: 9% to 21%) of the association between FGCRS and all-cause dementia. Interactions were not detected for FGCRS and PRS on the risk of any dementia subtype. We observed an 83% (95% CI: 47% to 128%) higher all-cause dementia risk comparing the high–high versus low–low FGCRS–PRS category. For brain volumes, higher FGCRS was associated with greater log-transformed white matter hyperintensities, smaller cortical volume and smaller grey matter volume. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the positive association of cardiovascular risk burden with dementia risk also applies to major dementia subtypes. The association of cardiovascular risk burden with all-cause dementia is largely independent of CVD onset and genetic predisposition to dementia. © 2024 BMJ Publishing Group.

Psychiatric disorders and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are risk factors for cognitive decline. Although older people in same-sex (SSR) compared to mixed-sex relationships (MSR) perform more poorly on cognitive screening tests, prior studies found no differences in rates of dementia diagnosis or neuropsychological profiles. We sought to explore the role of NPS on neurocognitive outcomes for SM populations. We compared cognitive performance and structural brain parameters of older adults in SSR and MSR. Methods: Data were originally collected at Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs). Inclusion criteria were: age of 55+ years, a study partner identified as a spouse/partner, and availability of T1-MRI brain volumes/thickness. Participants were labeled as either SSR or MSR based on their/their co-participant's reported sex. We identified 1,073 participants (1,037 MSR−555 cognitively unimpaired [CU]; 36 SSR−23 CU) with structural MRI data, Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) scores. A subset of the overall sample completed comprehensive neuropsychological assessment (n = 939; 908 MSR−494 CU; 31 SSR−22 CU). Covariates included in statistical models were age, sex, education, total intracranial volume, and apolipoprotein E genotype. Results: Multivariate general linear models showed significant diagnosis-by-relationship interaction effects on the left parahippocampal gyrus volume. After stratification by relationship group, only cognitively impaired (CI) MSR had significantly smaller left parahippocampal volumes than MSR-CU. The SSR group showed better episodic memory performance. Severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms was negatively associated with volume/thickness of bilateral fronto-temporal areas and with MMSE scores, predominantly in the MSR group. Conclusion: In our study, MSR participants presented with a more compromised cognitive profile than SSR participants. MSR-CI participants showed significantly smaller left medio-temporal volumes, a neural signature of AD. Neuropsychiatric symptoms predicted smaller fronto-temporal volumes in the MSR more consistently than in the SSR group. These findings may be due to unexplored protective factors against cognitive decline in SM elders. Indeed, social support has been proposed as a protective factor warranting future investigation.

Methods: Sixty patients (20 Alzheimer’s disease, 20 frontotemporal dementia, 20 mild cognitive impairment) and 20 controls were included retrospectively. One MRI per subject was processed by software packages from two proprietary manufacturers, producing two quantitative reports per subject. Two neuroradiologists assigned forced-choice diagnoses using only the normative volumetry data in these reports. They classified the volumetric profile as “normal,” or “abnormal”, and if “abnormal,” they specified the most likely dementia subtype. Differences between the packages’ clinical impact were assessed by comparing (1) agreement between diagnoses based on software output; (2) diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity; and (3) diagnostic confidence. Quantitative outputs were also compared to provide context to any diagnostic differences. Results: Diagnostic agreement between packages was moderate, for distinguishing normal and abnormal volumetry (K =.41–.43) and for specific diagnoses (K =.36–.38). However, each package yielded high inter-observer agreement when distinguishing normal and abnormal profiles (K =.73–.82). Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were not different between packages. Diagnostic confidence was different between packages for one rater. Whole brain intracranial volume output differed between software packages (10.73%, p <.001), and normative regional data interpreted for diagnosis correlated weakly to moderately (rs =.12–.80). Conclusion: Different artificial intelligence software packages for quantitative normative assessment of brain MRI can produce distinct effects at the level of clinical interpretation. Clinics should not assume that different packages are interchangeable, thus recommending internal evaluation of packages before adoption. © 2022, The Author(s).","Atrophy; Computer-assisted; Dementia; Diagnosis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Sensitivity and specificity","Alzheimer Disease; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Retrospective Studies; Software; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; artificial intelligence; brain atrophy; brain cortex; brain tissue; cerebellum; cerebrospinal fluid; controlled study; dementia; diagnosis related group; diagnostic accuracy; female; frontal lobe; frontotemporal dementia; gray matter; hippocampus; human; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; neuroradiologist; occipital lobe; parietal lobe; retrospective study; segmentation algorithm; sensitivity and specificity; T1 weighted imaging; temporal lobe; volumetry; white matter lesion; Alzheimer disease; brain; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; software","M.W.

Thus, the need for time efficient and cost-effective methods to facilitate an early diagnosis and prediction of future cognitive decline in patients with early cognitive symptoms is becoming increasingly important. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether an MRI based software, NeuroQuant® (NQ), producing volumetry of the hippocampus and whole brain volume (WBV) could predict: (1) conversion from subjective cognitive decline (SCD) at baseline to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia at follow-up, and from MCI at baseline to dementia at follow-up and (2) progression of cognitive and functional decline defined as an annual increase in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score. Methods: MRI was performed in 156 patients with SCD or MCI from the memory clinic at Oslo University Hospital (OUH) that had been assessed with NQ and had a clinical follow-up examination. Logistic and linear regression analyses were performed with hippocampus volume and WBV as independent variables, and conversion or progression as dependent variables, adjusting for demographic and other relevant covariates including Mini-Mental State Examination-Norwegian Revised Version score (MMSE-NR) and Apolipoprotein E ɛ4 (APOE ɛ4) carrier status. Results: Hippocampus volume, but not WBV, was associated with conversion to MCI or dementia, but neither were associated with conversion when adjusting for MMSE-NR. Both hippocampus volume and WBV were associated with progression as measured by the annual change in CDR-SB score in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Conclusion: The results indicate that automated regional MRI volumetry of the hippocampus and WBV can be useful in predicting further cognitive decline in patients with early cognitive symptoms.

It is possible that chronic inflammation, rather than 1 episode of inflammation, interacts with genetic vulnerability to increase the risk for AD. Objective: To study the interaction between the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype and chronic low-grade inflammation and its association with the incidence of AD. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, data from 2656 members of the Framingham Heart Study offspring cohort (Generation 2; August 13, 1971-November 27, 2017) were evaluated, including longitudinal measures of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), diagnoses of incident dementia including AD, and brain volume. Chronic low-grade inflammation was defined as having CRP at a high cutoff level at a minimum of 2 time points. Statistical analysis was performed from December 1, 1979, to December 31, 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures: Development of AD and brain volumes. Results: Of the 3130 eligible participants, 2656 (84.9%; 1227 men and 1429 women; mean [SD] age at last CRP measurement, 61.6 [9.5] years) with both ApoE status and longitudinal CRP measurements were included in this study analysis. Median (interquartile range) CRP levels increased with mean (SD) age (43.3 [9.6] years, 0.95 mg/L [0.40-2.35 mg/L] vs 59.1 [9.6] years, 2.04 mg/L [0.93-4.75 mg/L] vs 61.6 [9.5] years, 2.21 mg/L [1.05-5.12 mg/L]; P < .001), but less so among those with ApoE4 alleles, followed by ApoE3 then ApoE2 genotypes. During the 17 years of follow-up, 194 individuals (7.3%) developed dementia, 152 (78.4%) of whom had AD. ApoE4 coupled with chronic low-grade inflammation, defined as a CRP level of 8 mg/L or higher, was associated with an increased risk of AD, especially in the absence of cardiovascular diseases (hazard ratio, 6.63; 95% CI, 1.80-24.50; P = .005), as well as an increased risk of earlier disease onset compared with ApoE4 carriers without chronic inflammation (hazard ratio, 3.52; 95% CI, 1.27-9.75; P = .009). This phenomenon was not observed among ApoE3 and ApoE2 carriers with chronic low-grade inflammation. Finally, a subset of 1761 individuals (66.3%) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, and the interaction between ApoE4 and chronic low-grade inflammation was associated with brain atrophy in the temporal lobe (β = -0.88, SE = 0.22; P < .001) and hippocampus (β = -0.04, SE = 0.01; P = .005), after adjusting for confounders. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, peripheral chronic low-grade inflammation in participants with ApoE4 was associated with shortened latency for onset of AD. Rigorously treating chronic systemic inflammation based on genetic risk could be effective for the prevention and intervention of AD.","","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E4; Brain; C-Reactive Protein; Chronic Disease; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Inflammation; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; apolipoprotein E4; C reactive protein; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; blood; brain; chronic disease; cohort analysis; complication; diagnostic imaging; female; genetics; human; inflammation; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; risk factor; very elderly","","","NLM (Medline)","25743805","","","30646251","English","JAMA Netw Open","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063978462"

It was revised in 2017 (rFSRP) to reflect the modern data on vascular risk factors and stroke risk. Objective: This study examined the association between the rFSRP and cognitive and brain aging outcomes among participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set (UDS). Methods: Cross-sectional rFSRP was computed at baseline for 19,309 participants (mean age=72.84, SD=8.48) from the NACC-UDS [9,697 (50.2%) normal cognition, 4,705 (24.4%) MCI, 4,907 (25.4%) dementia]. Multivariable linear, logistic, or ordinal regressions examined the association between the rFSRP and diagnostic status, neuropsychological test performance, CDR® Sum of Boxes, as well as total brain volume (TBV), hippocampal volume (HCV), and log-transformed white matter hyperintensities (WMH) for an MRI subset (n=1,196). Models controlled for age, sex, education, racial identity, APOE ϵ4 status, and estimated intracranial volume for MRI models. Results: The mean rFSRP probability was 10.42% (min=0.50%, max=95.71%). Higher rFSRP scores corresponded to greater CDR Sum of Boxes (β=0.02, p=0.028) and worse performance on: Trail Making Test A (β=0.05, p<0.001) and B (β=0.057, p<0.001), and Digit Symbol (β=-0.058, p<0.001). Higher rFSRP scores were associated with increased odds for a greater volume of log-transformed WMH (OR=1.02 per quartile, p=0.015). No associations were observed for diagnosis, episodic memory or language test scores, HCV, or TBV. Conclusion: These results support the rFSRP as a useful metric to facilitate clinical research on the associations between cerebrovascular disease and cognitive and brain aging. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Unfortunately, the neurobiological underpinnings of this relationship are not clear. It is possible that the two disorders share a common, as yet unidentified, risk factor, or that hearing loss may independently accelerate AD pathology. Here, we examined the relationship between reported hearing loss and brain volumes in normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects using a publicly available database. We found that among subjects with AD, individuals that reported hearing loss had smaller brainstem and cerebellar volumes in both hemispheres than individuals without hearing loss. In addition, we found that these brain volumes diminish in size more rapidly among normal subjects with reported hearing loss and that there was a significant interaction between cognitive diagnosis and the relationship between reported hearing loss and these brain volumes. These data suggest that hearing loss is linked to brainstem and cerebellar pathology, but only in the context of the pathological state of AD. We hypothesize that the presence of AD-related pathology in both the brainstem and cerebellum creates vulnerabilities in these brain regions to auditory deafferentation-related atrophy. These data have implications for our understanding of the potential neural substrates for interactions between hearing loss and AD. © Copyright © 2021 Llano, Kwok, Devanarayan and The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).","Alzheimer’s; auditory; brainstem; cerebellum; dementia; presbycusis","aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain atrophy; brain region; brain size; brain stem; cell interaction; cerebellum cortex; cognition; controlled study; deafferentation; female; hearing impairment; hemisphere; human; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; substrate concentration; white matter","D.A.

This study aimed to identify the shared and distinct atrophy patterns between patients specified by SCD plus and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, a prodromal stage of AD) and to investigate the extent that automated brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetry can differentiate patients with SCD from normal control (NC) participants and patients with aMCI. We acquired structural MRI brain scans from 44 patients with aMCI, 40 patients with SCD (who met the major criteria of SCD plus), and 48 NC participants. Automatic brain segmentation was performed to quantify the volumetric measures of cognitive-relevant areas. These volumetric measures were compared across the 3 groups with analysis of variance. In addition, we performed support vector machine analyses using volumetric measures of single regions or multiple regions to further evaluate the sensitivity of automated brain volumetry in differentiating a specific group from another. The atrophy patterns in patients with aMCI and SCD were similar. Using the regional volumetric measures, we achieved high performance in differentiating aMCI and SCD from NCs (average classification accuracy [ACC] > 90%). However, the performance was not ideal when differentiating aMCI from SCD (ACC < 63%). In conclusion, patients with SCD specified by SCD plus presented similar atrophy patterns as patients with aMCI, which was distinguishable from NC participants. Future studies should aim to associate the atrophy patterns of SCD with possible conversion to aMCI or AD in a longitudinal design. © The Author(s) 2019.","Alzheimer disease; amnestic mild cognitive impairment; brain volumetry; magnetic resonance imaging; subjective cognitive decline","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; aged; aging; Alzheimer disease; amygdala; Article; atrophy; Clinical Dementia Rating; controlled study; demography; female; hippocampus; human; image analysis; image processing; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; memory disorder; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; Montreal cognitive assessment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; support vector machine; temporal lobe; volumetry; Alzheimer disease; brain; cancer staging; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures","Y.

Methods Blood NfL levels from 74 patients with bvFTD, 26 with Alzheimer disease (AD), 17 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 15 healthy controls (Con) at baseline and follow-up were determined and analyzed for the diagnostic potential in relation to functional assessment (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes [CDR-SOB], frontotemporal lobar degeneration–related CDR-SOB, Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]) and brain volumetry. Results At baseline, serum NfL level correlated with CSF NfL (bvFTD r = 0.706, p < 0.0001; AD/MCI r = 0.666, p = 0.0003). Highest serum levels were observed in bvFTD (p <0 0.0001 vs Con and MCI, p = 0.0078 vs AD, respectively). Discrimination of bvFTD from Con/MCI/AD was possible with 91%/74%/74% sensitivity and 79%/74%/58% specificity. At follow-up, serum NfL increased in bvFTD and AD (p = 0.0039 and p = 0.0006, respectively). At baseline and follow-up, NfL correlated with functional scores of patients with bvFTD (e.g., CDR-SOB [baseline] r = 0.4157, p = 0.0006; [follow-up] r = 0.5629, p < 0.0001) and with atrophy in the gray and white matter of many brain regions including frontal and subcortical areas (e.g., frontal lobe: r = −0.5857, p < 0.0001; 95% confidence interval −0.7415 to −0.3701). For patients with AD/MCI, NfL correlated with the functional performance as well (e.g., CDR-SOB [baseline] r = 0.6624, p < 0.0001; [followup] r = 0.5659, p = 0.0003) but not with regional brain volumes. Conclusions As serum NfL correlates with functional impairment and brain atrophy in bvFTD at different disease stages, we propose it as marker of disease severity, paving the way for its future use as outcome measure for clinical trials. Classification of evidence This study provides Class III evidence that for patients with cognitive problems, serum NfL concentration discriminates bvFTD from other forms of dementia.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Cross-sectional study of 1,713 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS) (mean age 75 years, 60% female, 27% black, 30% prediabetes, and 35% diabetes) who underwent 3T brain MRI scans in 2011-2013. Participants were categorized by diabetes-HbA1c status as without diabetes (<5.7% [reference]), with prediabetes (5.7 to <6.5%), and with diabetes ([defined as prior diagnosis or HbA1c ≥6.5%] <7.0% vs. ≥7.0%), with further stratification by diabetes duration (<10 vs. ≥10 years). RESULTS In adjusted analyses, comparedwith participantswithout diabetes and HbA1c <5.7%, participants with prediabetes and thosewith diabetes and HbA1c <7.0%did not have significantly different brain volumes or vascular pathology (all P > 0.05), but those with diabetes and HbA1c ≥7.0% had smaller total brain volume (b 20.20 SDs, 95% CI20.31,20.09), smaller regional brain volumes (including frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes; deep gray matter; Alzheimer disease signature region; and hippocampus [all P < 0.05]), and increased burden of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) (P = 0.016). Among participants with diabetes, those with HbA1c ≥7.0% had smaller total and regional brain volumes and an increased burden of WMH (all P < 0.05) compared with those with HbA1c <7.0%. Similarly, participants with longer duration of diabetes (≥10 years) had smaller brain volumes and higher burden of lacunes (all P < 0.05) than those with a diabetes duration <10 years. We found no evidence for mediation by WMH in associations of diabetes with smaller brain volumes by structural equation models (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS More-severe diabetes (defined by higher HbA1c and longer disease duration) but not prediabetes or less-severe diabetes was associated with smaller brain volumes and an increased burden of brain vascular pathology. No evidence was found that associations of diabetes with smaller brain volumes are mediated by brain vascular pathology, suggesting that other mechanismsmay be responsible for these associations. © 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Atherosclerosis; Biomarkers; Brain; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neurocognitive Disorders; Organ Size; Prediabetic State; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; hemoglobin A1c; biological marker; glycosylated hemoglobin; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Black person; brain region; brain size; cerebrovascular disease; Conference Paper; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease duration; disease severity; female; frontal lobe; gray matter; hemoglobin blood level; hippocampus; human; impaired glucose tolerance; lacunar stroke; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occipital lobe; parietal lobe; patient coding; temporal lobe; white matter; atherosclerosis; blood; brain; cerebrovascular disease; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic imaging; disorders of higher cerebral function; follow up; impaired glucose tolerance; metabolism; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathophysiology; prospective study; risk factor","A.L.C.

Objective: This study examines the diagnostic value of icobrain dm for AD in routine clinical practice, including a comparison to the widely used FreeSurfer software, and investigates if combined brain volumes contribute to establish an AD diagnosis. Methods: The study population included HC (n=90), subjective cognitive decline (SCD, n=93), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n=357), and ADD (n=280) patients. Through automated volumetric analyses of global, cortical, and subcortical brain structures on clinical brain MRI T1w (n=820) images from a retrospective, multi-center study (REMEMBER), icobrain dm's (v.4.4.0) ability to differentiate disease stages via ROC analysis was compared to FreeSurfer (v.6.0). Stepwise backward regression models were constructed to investigate if combined brain volumes can differentiate between AD stages. Results: icobrain dm outperformed FreeSurfer in processing time (15-30min versus 9-32h), robustness (0 versus 67 failures), and diagnostic performance for whole brain, hippocampal volumes, and lateral ventricles between HC and ADD patients. Stepwise backward regression showed improved diagnostic accuracy for pairwise group differentiations, with highest performance obtained for distinguishing HC from ADD (AUC=0.914; Specificity 83.0%; Sensitivity 86.3%). Conclusion: Automated volumetry has a diagnostic value for ADD diagnosis in routine clinical practice. Our findings indicate that combined brain volumes improve diagnostic accuracy, using real-world imaging data from a clinical setting. © 2021 - The authors.","Alzheimer's disease; automated volumetry; biomarkers; magnetic resonance imaging; mild cognitive impairment","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Retrospective Studies; Software; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain lateral ventricle; brain size; cephalometry; clinical practice; cohort analysis; contrast to noise ratio; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; disease severity; female; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging; frontal cortex; gray matter; gray matter volume; hippocampus; human; image analysis; image segmentation; left hippocampus; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occipital cortex; parietal cortex; radiodiagnosis; receiver operating characteristic; right hippocampus; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; temporal cortex; white matter; Youden index; Alzheimer disease; brain; clinical trial; cognitive defect; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; image processing; multicenter study; pathology; retrospective study; software","S.

Identifying which of these factors is most associated with AD is important for early diagnosis and treatment. Objective: We sought to examine genetic risk and structural brain volume on episodic memory in a sample of older adults ranging from cognitively normal to those diagnosed with AD. Methods: 686 adults (55-91 years old) completed a 3T MRI scan, baseline cognitive assessments, and biospecimen collection through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Hierarchical linear regression analyses examined main and interaction effects of medial temporal lobe (MTL) volume and polygenic hazard score (PHS), indicating genetic risk for AD, on a validated episodic memory composite score. Results: Genetic risk moderated the relationship between MTL volume and memory, such that individuals with high PHS and lower hippocampal and entorhinal volume had lower memory composite scores [F (1,677) = 4.057, p = 0.044, R2 = 0.002]. Further analyses showed this effect was driven by the left hippocampus [F(1,677) = 5.256, p = 0.022, R2 = 0.003] and right entorhinal cortex [F (1,677) = 6.078, p = 0.014, R2 = 0.003]. Conclusions: Among those with high genetic risk for AD, lower volume was associated with poorer memory. Results suggest that the interaction between AD genetic risk and MTL volume increases the likelihood for memory impairment among older adults. Results from this study suggest that genetic risk and brain volume should be considered key factors in tracking cognitive decline. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Our aim was to identify the structural brain measures that mitigate the negative effect of APOE ε4 on cognition, which would have implications for AD diagnosis and treatment trial selection. Methods: A total of 742 older adults (mean age: 70.1 ± 8.7 years) were stratified by APOE status and classified as cognitively normal (CDR 0) or with very mild dementia (CDR 0.5). Regional brain volume and cognitive performance were measured. Results: There were significant interactions between APOE and CDR on the left precuneus and on bilateral superior frontal volumes. These regions were preserved in CDR-0 ε3/ε4andε4/ε4 carriers but were reduced in CDR-0.5 ε3/ε4andε4/ε4 carriers, compared to their respective ε3/ε3 counterparts. Educational attainment predicted greater brain reserve. Discussion: This pattern of preserved brain structure in cognitively normal ε4 carriers with comprised medial temporal volume is consistent with the theory of brain reserve. © 2021 The Authors.","Alzheimer’s disease; APOE; Episodic memory; Genetic risk; Genotype; Neuroimaging genetics","apolipoprotein E; tau protein; adult; aerobic exercise; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain function; brain size; Clinical Dementia Rating; cognitive function test; cognitive reserve; cross-sectional study; disease severity; DNA extraction; episodic memory; executive function; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gene frequency; gene mutation; genetic association; genetic risk; genotype; glucose transport; human; human experiment; male; mental capacity; middle aged; Mini Mental State Examination; Montreal cognitive assessment; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; polymerase chain reaction; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; positron emission tomography; single nucleotide polymorphism; superior frontal gyrus; verbal memory; Wechsler adult intelligence scale; Wechsler memory scale; working memory","G.

Methods: Our forced-choice multi-rater clinical accuracy study used MRI from 16 AD patients, 14 FTD patients, and 15 healthy controls; age range 52–81. Our QReport was presented to raters with regional grey matter volumes plotted as percentiles against data from a normative population (n = 461). Nine raters with varying radiological experience (3 each: consultants, registrars, ‘non-clinical image analysts’) assessed each case twice (with and without the QReport). Raters were blinded to clinical and demographic information; they classified scans as ‘normal’ or ‘abnormal’ and if ‘abnormal’ as ‘AD’ or ‘FTD’. Results: The QReport improved sensitivity for detecting volume loss and AD across all raters combined (p = 0.015* and p = 0.002*, respectively). Only the consultant group’s accuracy increased significantly when using the QReport (p = 0.02*). Overall, raters’ agreement (Cohen’s κ) with the ‘gold standard’ was not significantly affected by the QReport; only the consultant group improved significantly (κs 0.41➔0.55, p = 0.04*). Cronbach’s alpha for interrater agreement improved from 0.886 to 0.925, corresponding to an improvement from ‘good’ to ‘excellent’. Conclusion: Our QReport referencing single-subject results to normative data alongside visual assessment improved sensitivity, accuracy, and interrater agreement for detecting volume loss. The QReport was most effective in the consultants, suggesting that experience is needed to fully benefit from the additional information provided by quantitative analyses. Key Points: • The use of quantitative report alongside routine visual MRI assessment improves sensitivity and accuracy for detecting volume loss and AD vs visual assessment alone. • Consultant neuroradiologists’ assessment accuracy and agreement (kappa scores) significantly improved with the use of quantitative atrophy reports. • First multi-rater radiological clinical evaluation of visual quantitative MRI atrophy report for use as a diagnostic aid in dementia. © 2021, The Author(s).","Alzheimer’s disease; Atrophy; Frontotemporal dementia; Magnetic resonance imaging; Radiologists","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Frontotemporal Dementia; Gray Matter; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; tau protein; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain atrophy; brain size; clinical article; clinical evaluation; cognition; contrast to noise ratio; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; differential diagnosis; disease duration; false negative result; false positive result; female; forced choice method; frontotemporal dementia; gray matter; hippocampus; human; interrater reliability; male; Mini Mental State Examination; neuroimaging; neuroradiologist; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quantitative analysis; signal noise ratio; volumetry; Alzheimer disease; atrophy; diagnostic imaging; frontotemporal dementia; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; very elderly","H.G.

To reduce the spatial correlation, computational complexity, and memory requirement, we use t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) on MRI volume to reduce its dimensions. Also, we use parallel CNN instead of sequential to analyze MRI volumes and a combination of RELU, sigmoid, and SIREN activation functions to learn better features for the classification of MCI. To check the efficacy of the proposed t-SNE Multiple-Activation Parallel Convolution Network, experiments are performed on publicly available Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, and performance is compared with existing methods.

However, these observations were largely from case-control studies with small sample sizes. Objective: To examine the interaction between APOE ϵ4 and BCHE-K on: 1) the risk of incident AD and 2) rates of change in brain volumes and cognitive performance during the preclinical stages of AD in a prospective cohort study. Methods: The study sample for survival analysis included 691 Caucasian participants (age at baseline, 58.4±9.9 years; follow-up time,16.9±9.7 years) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The neuroimaging sample included 302 participants with 1,388 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Cognitive performance was assessed in 703 participants over 4,908 visits. Results: A total of 122 diagnoses (79 AD, 43 mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) were identified. Participants with both APOE ϵ4 and BCHE-K variants had a 3.7-fold greater risk of AD (Hazard ratio [HR] 95% CI=1.99-6.89, p<0.001) compared to non-carriers of both genes (APOE ϵ4 x BCHE-K interaction p=0.025). There was no APOE ϵ4-BCHE-K interaction effect on rate of cognitive decline and brain atrophy. Conclusion: The APOE and BCHE genes interact to influence risk of incident AD/MCI but not rates of brain atrophy and decline in cognitive performance before onset of cognitive impairment. This may suggest the epistatic interaction between APOE ϵ4 and BCHE-K on AD risk is disease stage-dependent. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

Evidence Synthesis: In a number of studies, the severity of CD in type 1 diabetes was affected by the age of onset and duration, and the presence of proliferative retinopathy and autonomic neuropathy. Diabetes-related CD has been observed, not only in adults, but also in children and adolescents. Most neuroimaging studies of patients with type 1 diabetes did not show any differences in whole brain volumes; however, they did reveal selective deficits in gray matter volume or density within the frontal, posterior, and temporal cortex and subcortical gray matter. Studies of middle-age adults with long-standing type 1 diabetes using diffusion tensor imaging have demonstrated partial lesions in the white matter and decreased fractional anisotropy in posterior brain regions. The mechanisms underlying diabetes-related CD are very complex and include factors related to diabetes per se and to diabetes-related cardiovascular disease and microvascular dysfunction, including chronic hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, macro- and microvascular disease, and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. These mechanisms might contribute to the development and progression of both vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease. Conclusions: Higher rates of CD and faster progression in type 1 diabetes can be explained by both the direct effects of altered glucose metabolism on the brain and diabetes-related cardiovascular disease. Because the presence and progression of CD significantly worsens the quality of life of patients with diabetes, further multidisciplinary studies incorporating the recent progress in both neuroimaging and type 1 diabetes management are warranted to investigate this problem. © 2019 Endocrine Society","","aging; Alzheimer disease; autonomic neuropathy; brain region; brain size; cardiovascular disease; cognitive defect; diffusion tensor imaging; disease classification; disease course; disease severity; epidemiological data; fractional anisotropy; frontal cortex; glucose metabolism; gray matter; human; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; microangiopathy; multiinfarct dementia; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; onset age; priority journal; proliferative retinopathy; protein expression; quality of life; Review; temporal cortex","A.

It was hypothesized that both medial temporal atrophy (MTA) and global cortical atrophy (GCA) predicted no/mild pain, while white matter hyperintensities (WMH) predicted moderate/severe pain. Objectives: To study the association between pain intensity and measures of brain pathology, more specifically MTA, GCA, and WMH. Methods: In total, 115 consecutive patients visiting an outpatient memory clinic were included. In total, diagnoses included dementia (N=70), mild cognitive impairment (N=30), and subjective cognitive impairment (N=15). Without administering stimuli, pain intensity was assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory. MTA, GCA, and WMH were measured with a MRI visual rating scale. Logistic regression analyses to examine the relationship between WMH, MTA, GCA, and self-reported pain intensity (no/mild pain versus moderate/ severe pain) were adjusted for confounders. Results: Mean age of the patients was 81 years (IQR: 78-85, 53% female). Moderate/severe pain was reported by 23.5% and associated with greaterWMH (OR =3.34, 95%CI =1.01-10.97, p=0.047), but not MTA or GCA. Conclusions: In contrast to the present results, earlier studies have reported either a positive or negative relationship between pain and brain volume. It is suggested that the presence of dementia may explain the absence of a relationship between pain and brain volume. WMH is positively related with pain in an older memory outpatient population. Considering the small sample size, our findings should be interpreted with caution. Hence, our conclusions are preliminary findings, warranting future replication. © 2019 Ueberall et al.","Alzheimer’s disease; Brain atrophy; Dementia; Pain; White matter hyperintensities","age; aged; Article; brain atrophy; brain cortex atrophy; brain size; Brief Pain Inventory; cognitive defect; cross-sectional study; dementia; disease association; female; gender; human; major clinical study; male; medial temporal atrophy; mild cognitive impairment; outpatient department; pain assessment; pain intensity; self report; subjective cognitive impairment; very elderly; white matter hyperintensity; white matter lesion","E.J.A.

However, little is known about EA-CSF development in typically developing (TD) children or in children at risk for schizophrenia (SCZHR). Methods: 3T magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained in TD children (n = 105) and in SCZHR children (n = 38) at 1 and 2 years of age. EA-CSF volume and several measures of brain structure were generated, including global tissue volumes, cortical thickness, and surface area. Cognitive and motor abilities at 1 and 2 years of age were assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning. Results: In the TD children, EA-CSF volume was positively associated with total brain volume, gray and white matter volumes, and total surface area at 1 and 2 years of age. In contrast, EA-CSF volume was negatively associated with average cortical thickness. Lower motor ability was associated with increased EA-CSF volume at 1 year of age. EA-CSF was not significantly increased in SCZHR children compared with TD children. Conclusions: EA-CSF volume is positively associated with overall brain size and cortical surface area but negatively associated with cortical thickness. Increased EA-CSF is associated with delayed motor development at 1 year of age, similar to studies of children at risk for autism, suggesting that increased EA-CSF may be an early biomarker of abnormal brain development in infancy. Infants in the SCZHR group did not exhibit significantly increased EA-CSF, suggesting that increased EA-CSF could be specific to neurodevelopmental disorders with an earlier onset, such as autism. © 2020 Society of Biological Psychiatry","Early brain development; Extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid; High risk; Infancy; MRI; Schizophrenia","Autism Spectrum Disorder; Brain; Cognition; Female; Humans; Infant; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Schizophrenia; Article; brain development; brain size; brain tissue; brain ventricle; cerebrospinal fluid; cognition; cognitive development; cortical thickness (brain); female; gray matter; human; infant; major clinical study; male; motor development; motor performance; neuroanatomy; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; schizophrenia; surface area; white matter; autism; brain","J.H.

We investigated neuroanatomical subtypes in a multi-institutional multi-ethnic cohort, using novel semi-supervised machine learning methods designed to discover patterns associated with disease rather than normal anatomical variation. Structural MRI and clinical measures in established schizophrenia (n = 307) and healthy controls (n = 364) were analysed across three sites of PHENOM (Psychosis Heterogeneity Evaluated via Dimensional Neuroimaging) consortium. Regional volumetric measures of grey matter, white matter, and CSF were used to identify distinct and reproducible neuroanatomical subtypes of schizophrenia. Two distinct neuroanatomical subtypes were found. Subtype 1 showed widespread lower grey matter volumes, most prominent in thalamus, nucleus accumbens, medial temporal, medial prefrontal/frontal and insular cortices. Subtype 2 showed increased volume in the basal ganglia and internal capsule, and otherwise normal brain volumes. Grey matter volume correlated negatively with illness duration in Subtype 1 (r = -0.201, P = 0.016) but not in Subtype 2 (r = -0.045, P = 0.652), potentially indicating different underlying neuropathological processes. The subtypes did not differ in age (t = -1.603, df = 305, P = 0.109), sex (chi-square = 0.013, df = 1, P = 0.910), illness duration (t = -0.167, df = 277, P = 0.868), antipsychotic dose (t = -0.439, df = 210, P = 0.521), age of illness onset (t = -1.355, df = 277, P = 0.177), positive symptoms (t = 0.249, df = 289, P = 0.803), negative symptoms (t = 0.151, df = 289, P = 0.879), or antipsychotic type (chi-square = 6.670, df = 3, P = 0.083). Subtype 1 had lower educational attainment than Subtype 2 (chi-square = 6.389, df = 2, P = 0.041). In conclusion, we discovered two distinct and highly reproducible neuroanatomical subtypes. Subtype 1 displayed widespread volume reduction correlating with illness duration, and worse premorbid functioning. Subtype 2 had normal and stable anatomy, except for larger basal ganglia and internal capsule, not explained by antipsychotic dose. These subtypes challenge the notion that brain volume loss is a general feature of schizophrenia and suggest differential aetiologies.

This study aims to characterise patterns of brain volume loss in six primary pathologies compared with controls and to each other. Methods One hundred and eighty-six patients with a clinical diagnosis of dementia and histopathological confirmation of underlying pathology, and 73 healthy controls were included in this study. Voxel-based morphometry, based on ante-mortem T1-weighted MRI, was used to identify cross-sectional group differences in brain volume. Results Early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease exhibited different patterns of grey matter volume loss, with more extensive temporoparietal involvement in the early-onset group, and more focal medial temporal lobe loss in the late-onset group. The Presenilin-1 group had similar parietal involvement to the early-onset group with localised volume loss in the thalamus, medial temporal lobe and temporal neocortex. Lewy body pathology was associated with less extensive volume loss than the other pathologies, although precentral/postcentral gyri volume was reduced in comparison with other pathological groups. Tau and TDP43A pathologies demonstrated similar patterns of frontotemporal volume loss, although less extensive on the right in the 4-repeat-Tau group, with greater parietal involvement in the TDP43A group. The TDP43C group demonstrated greater left anterior-Temporal involvement. Conclusions Pathologically distinct dementias exhibit characteristic patterns of regional volume loss compared with controls and other dementias. Voxelwise differences identified in these cohorts highlight imaging signatures that may aid in the differentiation of dementia subtypes during life.

Given that brain pathology precedes clinical symptom onset, we set out to test whether metabolites in blood associated with pathology as indexed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers. Methods: This study analyzed 593 plasma samples selected from the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery study, of individuals who were cognitively healthy (n = 242), had mild cognitive impairment (n = 236), or had AD-type dementia (n = 115). Logistic regressions were carried out between plasma metabolites (n = 883) and CSF markers, magnetic resonance imaging, cognition, and clinical diagnosis. Results: Eight metabolites were associated with amyloid β and one with t-tau in CSF, these were primary fatty acid amides (PFAMs), lipokines, and amino acids. From these, PFAMs, glutamate, and aspartate also associated with hippocampal volume and memory. Discussion: PFAMs have been found increased and associated with amyloid β burden in CSF and clinical measures. © 2019","Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid; Biomarkers; Brain volume measurements; Cognitive function measurements; CSF; Dementia; EMIF-AD; Metabolomics; Tau","Aged; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloidosis; Biomarkers; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cohort Studies; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory; Metabolomics; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; tau Proteins; amide; amino acid; amyloid beta protein; aspartic acid; biological marker; cholinesterase inhibitor; fatty acid; glutamic acid; oleamide; tau protein; amyloid beta protein; biological marker; tau protein; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain function; brain size; cognition; cohort analysis; controlled study; dementia; disease association; female; hippocampus; human; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; memory; metabolomics; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; plasma; predictive value; priority journal; protein cerebrospinal fluid level; amyloidosis; blood; brain; cerebrospinal fluid; cognitive defect; hippocampus; metabolism; metabolomics; middle aged; pathology; physiology","C.

Given its broad symptomatic manifestation, including chronic pain, fatigue, neurological, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and skin problems, it is of interest to examine whether GWI is associated with changes in the brain. Existing neuroimaging studies, however, have been limited by small sample sizes, inconsistent GWI diagnosis criteria, and potential comorbidity confounds. Objectives: Using a large cohort of US veterans with GWI, we assessed regional brain volumes for their associations with GWI, and quantified the relationships between any regional volumetric changes and GWI symptoms. Methods: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 111 veterans with GWI (Age = 49 ± 6, 88 % Male) and 59 healthy controls (age = 51 ± 9, 78 % male) were collected at the California War Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC-CA) and from a multicenter study of the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI), respectively. Individual MRI volumes were segmented and parcellated using FreeSurfer. Regional volumes of 19 subcortical, 68 cortical, and 3 brainstem structures were evaluated in the GWI cohort relative to healthy controls. The relationships between regional volumes and GWI symptoms were also assessed. Results: We found significant subcortical atrophy, but no cortical differences, in the GWI group relative to controls, with the largest effect detected in the brainstem, followed by the ventral diencephalon and the thalamus. In a subsample of 58 veterans with GWI who completed the Chronic Fatigue Scale (CFS) inventory of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), smaller brainstem volumes were significantly correlated with increased severities of fatigue and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: The findings suggest that brainstem volume may be selectively affected by GWI, and that the resulting atrophy could in turn mediate or moderate GWI-related symptoms such as fatigue and depression. Consequently, the brain stem should be carefully considered in future research focusing on GWI pathology. © 2020","Brain volumetric analysis; Brainstem; Chronic multi-symptom illness; Fatigue; Gulf War; Magnetic resonance imaging","Adult; Atrophy; Brain; Brain Stem; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Persian Gulf Syndrome; Veterans; adult; atrophy; brain; brain stem; cohort analysis; diagnostic imaging; female; human; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; Persian Gulf syndrome; veteran","Y.

In this paper we describe and validate icobrain dm, an automatic tool that segments brain structures that are relevant for differential diagnosis of dementia, such as the hippocampi and cerebral lobes. Experiments were conducted in comparison to the widely used FreeSurfer software. The hippocampus segmentations were compared against manual segmentations, with significantly higher Dice coefficients obtained with icobrain dm (25–75th quantiles: 0.86–0.88) than with FreeSurfer (25–75th quantiles: 0.80–0.83). Other brain structures were also compared against manual delineations, with icobrain dm showing lower volumetric errors overall. Test-retest experiments show that the precision of all measurements is higher for icobrain dm than for FreeSurfer except for the parietal cortex volume. Finally, when comparing volumes obtained from Alzheimer's disease patients against age-matched healthy controls, all measures achieved high diagnostic performance levels when discriminating patients from cognitively healthy controls, with the temporal cortex volume measured by icobrain dm reaching the highest diagnostic performance level (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.99) in this dataset. © 2020 The Authors","Alzheimer's disease (AD); Brain segmentation software; Dementia; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Software; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; automation; brain; brain size; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; frontal cortex; gray matter; hippocampus; human; image segmentation; lateral brain ventricle; major clinical study; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parietal cortex; priority journal; temporal cortex; validation study; volumetry; Alzheimer disease; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; software","D.M.

We hypothesize that greater vascular burden will have an additive negative impact on cognition after accounting for baseline cognitive impairment, positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid burden, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures. Methods: Individuals were followed an average of 5 years with serial cognitive assessments. Predictor variables include vascular burden score (VBS), quantitative brain MRI assessment, and amyloid imaging. Subjects consisted of 65 individuals, 53% of whom were male, aged 73.2±7.2 years on average with an average of 15.5±3.3 years of educational achievement. Results: Baseline cognitive impairment was significantly associated poorer episodic memory (p < 0.0001), smaller hippocampal volume (p < 0.0001), smaller brain volume (p = 0.0026), and greater global Pittsburg Imaging Compound B (PiB) index (p = 0.0008). Greater amyloid burden was associated with greater decline in episodic memory over time (β= -0.20±0.07, p < 0.005). VBS was significantly associated with the level of executive function performance (β= -0.14±0.05, p < 0.005) and there was a significant negative interaction between VBS, cognitive impairment, and PiB index (β= -0.065±0.03, p = 0.03). Conclusions: Our results find a significant influence of VBS independent of standard MRI measures and cerebral amyloid burden on executive function. In addition, VBS reduced the amount of cerebral amyloid burden needed to result in cognitive impairment. We conclude that the systemic effects of vascular disease as reflected by the VBS independently influence cognitive ability. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

They will not only support the clinical diagnosis of dementia but also allow for timely pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions and evaluations. Objective: To identify and validate a novel blood-based microRNA biomarker for dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). Methods: We conducted microRNA sequencing using peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a discovery cohort and validated the identified miRNAs in an independent cohort and AD postmortem tissues. miRNA correlations with AD pathology and AD clinical-radiological imaging were conducted. We also performed bioinformatics and cell-based assay to identify miRNA target genes. Results: We found that miR-150-5p expression was significantly upregulated in DAT compared to mild cognitive impairment and healthy subjects. Upregulation of miR-150-5p was observed in AD hippocampus. We further found that higher miR-150-5p levels were correlated with the clinical measures of DAT, including lower global cognitive scores, lower CSF Aβ42, and higher CSF total tau. Interestingly, we observed that higher miR-150-5p levels were associated with MRI brain volumes within the default mode and executive control networks, two key networks implicated in AD. Furthermore, pathway analysis identified the targets of miR-150-5p to be enriched in the Wnt signaling pathway, including programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4). We found that PDCD4 was downregulated in DAT blood and was downregulated by miR-150-5p at both the transcriptional and protein levels Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that miR-150-5p is a promising clinical blood-based biomarker for DAT  © 2022 - IOS Press.

It has been discovered that the grey matter volume shrinkage may indicate the possible case of dementia and related diseases like AD. Clinicians and radiologists use imaging techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) scan, and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to diagnose and visualize the tissue contents of the brain. Using the whole brain MRI as the feature is an on-going approach among machine learning researchers, however, we are interested only in grey matter content. First, we segment the MRI using the SPM (Statistical parameter mapping) tool and then apply the smoothing technique to get a 3D image of grey matter (later called as grey version) from each MRI. This image file is then fed into 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with necessary pre-processing so that it can train the network, to produce a classifying model. Once trained, an untested MRI (i.e. its grey version) can be passed through the CNN to determine whether it is a healthy control (HC), or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to AD (mAD) or AD dementia (ADD). Our validation and testing accuracy are reported here and compared with normal MRI and its grey version. © 2021, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

Currently, a diagnosis of AD depends on the clinical symptoms of dementia, magnetic resonance imaging to determine brain volume, and positron emission tomography imaging to detect brain amyloid or tau deposition. The best characterized biological fluid markers for AD are decreased levels of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) 42 and increased levels of phosphorylated tau and total tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, less invasive and easily detectable biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD, especially at the early stage, are still under development. Here, we provide an overview of various biomarkers identified in CSF and blood for the diagnostics of AD over the last 25 years. CSF biomarkers that reflect the three hallmarks of AD, amyloid deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration, are well established. Based on the need to start treatment in asymptomatic people with AD and to screen for AD risk in large numbers of young, healthy individuals, the development of biomarkers for AD is shifting from CSF to blood. Elements of the core pathogenesis of AD in blood, including Aβ42, tau proteins, plasma proteins, or lipids have shown their usefulness and capabilities in AD diagnosis. We also highlight some novel identified blood biomarkers (including Aβ42/Aβ43, p-tau 181, Aβ42/APP669-711, structure of Aβ in blood, and flotillin) for AD. © 2020 by the authors.

Sergievsky Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States","Importance: Results from longitudinal studies suggest that regular leisure time physical activity (LTPA) is associated with reduced risk of dementia or Alzheimer disease. Data on the association between LTPA and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures remain scarce and inconsistent. Objective: To examine the association of LTPA and MRI-assessed brain aging measures in a multiethnic elderly population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included 1443 older (≥65 years) adults without dementia who were participants of the Washington/Hamilton Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project study. LTPA, from self-reported questionnaire, was calculated as metabolic equivalent of energy expenditure. Both moderate to vigorous LTPA, assessed as meeting Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (≥150 minutes/week) or not, and light-intensity LTPA were also examined. Exposures: LTPA. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes included total brain volume (TBV), cortical thickness, and white matter hyperintensity volume, all derived from MRI scans with established methods and adjusted for intracranial volume when necessary. We examined the association of LTPA with these imaging markers using regression models adjusted for demographic, clinical, and vascular risk factors. Results: The 1443 participants of the study had a mean (SD) age of 77.2 (6.4) years; 921 (63.8%) were women; 27.0%, 34.4%, and 36.3% were non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic African American, and Hispanic individuals, respectively; and 27.3% carried the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ϵ4 allele. Compared with the LTPA of nonactive older adults, those with the most LTPA had larger (in cm3) TBV (β [SE], 13.17 [4.42] cm3; P =.003; P for trend =.006) and greater cortical thickness (β [SE], 0.016 [0.008] mm; P =.05; P for trend =.03). The effect size comparing the highest LTPA level with the nonactive group was equivalent to approximately 3 to 4 years of aging (β for 1 year older,-3.06 and-0.005 for TBV and cortical thickness, respectively). A dose-response association was found and even the lowest LTPA level had benefits (eg, TBV: β [SE], 9.03 [4.26] cm3; P =.03) compared with the nonactive group. Meeting Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (TBV: β [SE], 18.82 [5.14] cm3; P <.001) and light-intensity LTPA (TBV: β [SE], 9.26 [4.29] cm3; P =.03) were also associated with larger brain measures. The association between LTPA and TBV was moderated by race/ethnicity, sex, and APOE status, but generally existed in all subgroups. The results remained similar after excluding participants with mild cognitive impairment. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, more physical activity was associated with larger brain volume in older adults. Longitudinal studies are warranted to explore the potential role of physical activity in brain health among older individuals. © 2020 American Medical Association.

Methods: T1w MRI scans are preprocessed in a standardized way comprising gray matter (GM) segmentation, normalization, modulation, and spatial smoothing. Resulting GM images are then compared to precomputed age- and sex-specific GM templates derived from the population-based Nathan Kline Institute Rockland Sample, and voxel-wise z-maps are compiled. z-maps are color-coded and fused with the subject’s T1w images. The rate of technical success of the proposed workflow was evaluated in 1330 subjects of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Furthermore, medial temporal atrophy (MTA) was assessed using the color-coded maps and with the MTA visual rating scale in these subjects. Sensitivities and specificity of color-coded maps and MTA scale were compared using McNemar’s test. Results: One test dataset was excluded due to severe motion artifacts. Out of the remaining 1329 datasets, atrophy map generation was successful in 1323 ADNI subjects (99.5%). Sensitivity for AD diagnosis (71.4 % vs. 53.3%, p < 0.0001 for left; 70.4% vs. 55.3%, p < 0.0001 for right hemisphere) and for MCI (45.4% vs. 17.4, p < 0.0001 for left; 43.5% vs. 14.6%, p < 0.0001 for right hemisphere) based on medial temporal atrophy assessment in color-coded maps was significantly higher than for MTA visual rating scale, while specificity was lower (78.4% vs. 93.8%, p < 0.0001 for left; 79.4% vs. 95.8%, p < 0.0001 for right hemisphere). The workflow is named veganbagel and is published as open-source software with an integrated PACS interface. Conclusions: Automated brain volume change estimation with the proposed workflow is feasible and technically dependable. It provides high potential for radiologic assessment of brain volume changes and neurodegenerative diseases. Key Points: • A workflow combining techniques from voxel-based morphometry and population-based neuroimaging data is feasible and technically highly dependable. • The workflow is provided as open-source software, named veganbagel. • Sensitivity of medial temporal atrophy assessment in atrophy maps from veganbagel exceeds the sensitivity of MTA visual rating scale for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. © 2020, The Author(s).","Atrophy; Brain; Gray matter; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases","Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Brain; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Workflow; adult; age; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain atrophy; brain size; cohort analysis; controlled study; data analysis software; digital imaging and communications in medicine; evaluation study; feasibility study; female; gray matter; human; image analysis; image segmentation; left hemisphere; major clinical study; male; McNemar test; medial temporal lobe; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; rating scale; right hemisphere; sensitivity and specificity; sex; software; voxel based morphometry; Alzheimer disease; atrophy; brain; degenerative disease; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; workflow","J.

Materials and Methods: Two hundred and one subjects were examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Visual rating and volumetry were performed in all subjects at ages 75 and 80. Cognitive function at both time points was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Trail Making Tests A and B (TMT-A and TMT-B). Changes in visual rating and volumetry were compared with changes in cognitive test. Results: A correlation was found between visual rating of medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) and hippocampal volumetry at both time points (rs = −.42 and rs = −.49, p <.001, respectively). The correlation between visual rating of posterior atrophy (PA); frontal atrophy (F-GCA) and volumetry of these brain regions was significant only at age 80 (rs = −.16, p =.02 for PA and rpb =.19, p =.006 for F-GCA). Visual rating showed only a minimal progression of regional atrophy at age 80, whereas volumetry showed 2%–5% decrease in volume depending on brain region. Performance in the MMSE, TMT-A, and TMT-B was virtually unchanged between ages 75 and 80. Conclusion: We found a mild age-associated decrease in regional brain volumes in this healthy cohort with well-preserved cognitive functions. Visual assessment may not be sufficient for detecting mild progression of brain atrophy due to normal aging, whereas volumetry is more sensitive to capture these subtle changes. © 2020 The Authors.

Overlap in the genetics of psychotic disorders and brain measures has been found in European populations, but has not been explored in populations of African ancestry. The aim of this study was to determine whether a relationship exists between a schizophrenia-derived PRS and (i) methamphetamine associated psychosis (MAP), and (ii) brain structural measures, in a South African population. Methods: The study sample consisted of three participant groups: 31 individuals with MAP, 48 with apsychotic methamphetamine dependence, and 49 healthy controls. Using PRSice, PRS was generated for each of the participants with GWAS summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Schizophrenia working group (PGC-SCZ2) as the discovery dataset. Regression analyses were performed to determine associations of PRS, with diagnosis, whole brain, and regional gray and white matter measures. Results: Schizophrenia-derived PRS did not significantly predict MAP diagnosis. After correction for multiple testing, no significant associations were found between PRS and brain measures across all groups. Discussion: The lack of significant associations here may indicate that the study is underpowered, that brain volumes in MAP are due to factors other than polygenic risk for schizophrenia, or that PRS derived from a largely European discovery set has limited utility in individuals of African ancestry. Larger studies, that include diverse populations, and more nuanced brain measures, may help elucidate the relationship between schizophrenia-PRS, brain structural changes, and psychosis. Conclusion: This research presents the first PRS study to investigate shared genetic effects across psychotic disorders and brain structural measures in an African population. Ancestrally comparable discovery datasets may be useful for future African genetic research. © Copyright © 2020 Passchier, Stein, Uhlmann, van der Merwe and Dalvie.","Africa; brain measures; methamphetamine associated psychosis; polygenic risk; schizophrenia","methamphetamine; adult; allele; Article; brain size; case control study; cortical thickness (brain); DNA extraction; female; gene frequency; genetic analysis; genetic risk; genotype; gray matter; human; major clinical study; male; methamphetamine dependence; methamphetamine-induced psychosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prevalence; psychosis; schizophrenia; white matter","R.V.

Predicting AD from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitive normal (CN) has become popular. Neuroimaging and computer-aided diagnosis techniques are used for classification of AD by physicians in the early stage. Most of the previous machine learning techniques work on handpicked features. In the recent days, deep learning has been applied for many medical image applications. Existing deep learning systems work on raw magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images and cortical surface as an input to the convolution neural network (CNN) to perform classification of AD. AD affects the brain volume and changes the gray matter texture. In our work, we used 1820 T2-weighted brain magnetic resonance volumes including 635 AD MRIs, 548 MCI MRIs, and 637 CN MRIs, sliced into 18,017 voxels. We proposed an approach to extract the gray matter from brain voxels and perform the classification using the CNN. A Gaussian filter is used to enhance the voxels, and skull stripping algorithm is used to remove the irrelevant tissues from enhanced voxels. Then, those voxels are segmented by hybrid enhanced independent component analysis. Segmented gray matter is used as an input to the CNN. We performed clinical valuation using our proposed approach and achieved 90.47% accuracy, 86.66% of recall, and 92.59% precision. © 2019","Alzheimer's disease; Clinical evaluation; CNN; Gaussian Mixture model; Independent component analysis","adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain size; clinical evaluation; convolutional neural network; disease classification; female; gray matter; human; independent component analysis; major clinical study; male; mathematical computing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; segmentation algorithm","S.

We aimed to identify the neuroanatomical correlates of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia in patients with T2DM, using advanced multimodal MRI. Methods and results: Twenty-five patients (≥70 years) with T2DM and MCI (n = 22) or early dementia (n = 3) were included. The reference group consisted of 23 patients with T2DM with intact cognition. All patients underwent a 3 T MRI. Brain volumes and white matter hyperintensity volumes were obtained with automated segmentation methods. White matter connectivity was assessed with diffusion tensor imaging and fiber tractography. Infarcts and microbleeds were rated visually. Compared to patients without cognitive impairment, those with impairment had a lower grey matter volume (effect size: −0.58, p=0.042), especially in the right temporal lobe and subcortical brain regions (effect sizes: −0.45 to −0.91, false discovery rate corrected p < 0.05). White matter volume (effect size: −0.47, p = 0.11) and white matter connectivity (effect size: 0.55, p = 0.054) were also reduced in patients with versus without cognitive impairment, albeit not statistically significant. White matter hyperintensity volumes and occurrence of other vascular lesions did not differ between the two patient groups. Conclusion: In patients with T2DM, grey matter atrophy rather than vascular brain injury appears to be the primary imaging correlate of MCI and early dementia. © 2018 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University","Cognitive dysfunction; Dementia; Diffusion tensor imaging; Mild cognitive impairment; MRI; Type 2 diabetes mellitus","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Atrophy; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dementia; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Early Diagnosis; Female; Gray Matter; Humans; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; 2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; metformin; sulfonylurea; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain atrophy; brain hemorrhage; brain infarction size; clinical article; cognition assessment; cognitive defect; controlled study; daily life activity; dementia; depression; depth perception; diffusion tensor imaging; female; fractional anisotropy; functional neuroimaging; gray matter; human; hypertension; image segmentation; male; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; multiinfarct dementia; neuroanatomy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; tractography; white matter; atrophy; brain; case control study; cognition; cognitive defect; complication; cross-sectional study; dementia; diagnostic imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; early diagnosis; neuropsychological test; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathology; predictive value; psychology; risk factor; very elderly","O.

Materials and methods: From 1500 EPAD participants, 312 were excluded. Cerebrospinal fluid cut-offs of 1000 pg/mL for amyloid beta (Aß)1-42 and 27 pg/mL for p-tau181 were validated using Gaussian mixture models. Given strong correlation of p-tau and t-tau (R2 = 0.98, P < 0.001), neurodegeneration was defined by age-adjusted hippocampal volume. Multinomial regressions were used to test whether neuropsychological tests and regional brain volumes could distinguish ATN stages. Results: Age was 65 ± 7 years, with 58% females and 38% apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers; 57.1% were A–T–N–, 32.5% were in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum, and 10.4% suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology. Age and cerebrovascular burden progressed with biomarker positivity (P < 0.001). Cognitive dysfunction appeared with T+. Paradoxically higher regional gray matter volumes were observed in A+T–N– compared to A–T–N– (P < 0.001). Discussion: In non-demented individuals along the AD continuum, p-tau drives cognitive dysfunction. Memory and language domains are affected in the earliest stages. © 2021 The Authors.

We have described hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a signaling molecule important in vascular homeostasis, as a biomarker of cardiovascular disease. We hypothesize that plasma H2S and its metabolites also relate to vascular and cognitive dysfunction in ADRD. We used analytical biochemical methods to measure plasma H2S metabolites and MRI to evaluate indicators of microvascular disease in ADRD. Levels of total H2S and specific metabolites were increased in ADRD versus controls. Cognition and microvascular disease indices were correlated with H2S levels. Total plasma sulfide was the strongest indicator of ADRD, and partially drove the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and white matter lesion volume, an indicator of microvascular disease. Our findings show that H2S is dysregulated in dementia, providing a potential biomarker for diagnosis and intervention. © 2021 The Authors.

The most prevalent, reliable and result-oriented methods for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease are: Firstly, measuring the rate of atrophy of the hippocampus and total brain volume; Secondly, extracting information from the gray matter, white matter and cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) of the brain. In this work, different statistical features such as contrast, homogeneity, correlation, energy and also shape features are extracted from the MRI images. For every image a number of features are extracted and these are fed to the classifier. The images are classified into any of the three classes: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Normal Control (NC). The proposed approach compares the performances of Probabilistic Neural Network(PNN), Support Vector Machines(SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN) in terms of their accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. The MRI images are obtained from the ADNI database. ADNI is a clinically validated database of MRI, PET and FMRI images of subjects. © 2018 IEEE.","Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM); K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN); Principal Component Analysis(PCA); Probabilistic Neural Net-works(PNN); Support Vector Machines(SVM)","Cerebrospinal fluid; Diagnosis; Disease control; Image classification; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Neurodegenerative diseases; Principal component analysis; Support vector machines; Cerebro spinal fluids; Extracting information; Gray level co occurrence matrix(GLCM); K nearest neighbours (k-NN); Mild cognitive impairments (MCI); Probabilistic Neural Net-works(PNN); Probabilistic neural networks; Statistical features; Magnetic resonance imaging","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-153864966-4","","","English","Int.

It facilitates the automatic interpretation or diagnosis that helps in surgical planning, estimating the changes in the brain’s volume for various types of tissues, and recognizing different neural disorders. Many neurological disorders like epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, tumor, and cancer can be effectively quantified and analyzed by finding the volume of the brain tissues such as White Matter (WM), Gray Matter (GM), and Cerebrospinal Fluids (CSF). In manual segmentation of brain MRIs physicians manually determines the boundaries of different objects of interest and it is time-consuming and difficult. Thus, several accurate automatic brain MRI segmentation techniques with different levels of complexity have been proposed. This paper proposes an advanced thresholding technique for the segmentation of brain MRIs based on the biologically inspired Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. Here the texture features are assumed as heuristic data. The experimental results for the T1-weighted brain MRIs have shown high accuracy than the conventional such as Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), Expectation-Maximization (EM), Improved Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (IBFA), and Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO). © 2020 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.","Ant Colony optimization; Brain magnetic resonance images; Cerebrospinal fluid; Gray matter; Image segmentation; Meta-Heuristic algorithms; Multilevel thresholding; Texture features; White matter","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Biomimetics; Brain; Brain mapping; Diagnosis; Heuristic algorithms; Histology; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Maximum principle; Neurology; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Textures; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Brain magnetic resonance images; Gray matter; Meta heuristic algorithm; Multilevel thresholding; Texture features; White matter; Cerebrospinal fluid","G.

Early detection of AD can help with proper treatment and prevent brain tissue damage. Traditional medical tests are time consuming, fail to recognize early signs and lack of diagnosis sensitivity and specificity. To achieve promising prediction accuracy, the best predictive machine learning model is selected based on initial pre-processing step followed by vital attributes selection and performance evaluation for five proposed supervised machine learning algorithms. In the pre-processing, all the missing values have been removed since the overall percentage only covered 5.63%. Boruta algorithm as feature selection method resulted Atlas Scaling Factor, Estimated Total Intracranial Volume, Normalized Whole-brain Volume, Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating must be included as primary features. With Boruta algorithm, it has been shown that Random Forest Grid Search Cross Validation (RF GSCV) outperformed with 94.39% of accuracy, 88.24% sensitivity, 100.00% specificity and 94.44% AUC among other 12 models that includes conventional and fine-tuned models even for the small OASIS-2 longitudinal MRI dataset. Finally, our developed Graphical User Interface (GUI) prediction tool was evaluated through prediction over OASIS-1 cross-sectional MRI dataset containing 216 samples of imaging sessions that have been pre-processed. Prediction results were closed with the dementia status provided in OASIS cross-sectional data fact sheet. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Considering that neuroimaging changes in the hippocampus and default mode network (DMN) are promising important candidate biomarkers and have been included in the research criteria for the diagnosis of AD, it is hypothesized that atrophy and metabolic changes of the abovementioned regions could be evaluated concurrently to fully explore the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in AD. Twenty-three AD patients and Twenty-four age-, sex- and education level-matched normal controls underwent a clinical interview, a detailed neuropsychological assessment and a simultaneous 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET)/high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan on a hybrid GE SIGNA PET/MR scanner. Brain volume and glucose metabolism were examined in patients and controls to reveal group differences. Multiple linear regression models were employed to explore the relationship between multiple imaging features and cognitive performance in AD. The AD group had significantly reduced volume in the hippocampus and DMN regions (P < 0.001) relative to that of normal controls determined by using ROI analysis. Compared to normal controls, significantly decreased metabolism in the DMN (P < 0.001) was also found in AD patients, which still survived after controlling for gray matter atrophy (P < 0.001). These findings from ROI analysis were further confirmed by whole-brain confirmatory analysis (P < 0.001, FWE-corrected). Finally, multiple linear regression results showed that impairment of multiple cognitive tasks was significantly correlated with the combination of DMN hypometabolism and atrophy in the hippocampus and DMN regions. This study demonstrated that combining functional and structural features can better explain the cognitive decline of AD patients than unimodal FDG or brain volume changes alone. These findings may have important implications for understanding the neural mechanisms of cognitive decline in AD. © 2021 Chen et al.

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. Participants: A community sample of adults who were 44 to 66 years of age at study baseline. Measurements: Active surveillance of local hospitals and annual participant contact were used to gather hospitalization information (including International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes) on all participants over a 24-year surveillance period. Subsequently, a subset of participants underwent 3-Tesla brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify total and regional brain volumes, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, and white matter microstructural integrity (fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) as measured using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)). Results: Of the 1,689 participants included (mean age at MRI 76±5), 72% were hospitalized, 14% had a major infection, and 4% had a critical illness during the surveillance period. Using covariate-adjusted regression, hospitalization was associated with 0.12–standard deviation (SD) greater WMH volume (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.00–0.24) and poorer white matter microstructural integrity (0.17-SD lower FA, 95% CI=–0.27 to –0.06; 0.16-SD greater MD, 95% CI=0.07–0.25) than no hospitalization. There was a dose-dependent relationship between number of hospitalizations, smaller brain volumes, and lower white matter integrity (p-trends ≤.048). In hospitalized participants, critical illness was associated with smaller Alzheimer's disease (AD) signature region (–1.64 cm3, 95% CI=–3.16 to –0.12); major infection was associated with smaller AD signature region (–1.28 cm3, 95% CI=–2.21 to –0.35) and larger ventricular volume (3.79 cm3, 95% CI= 0.81–6.77). Conclusions: Whereas all-cause hospitalization was primarily associated with lower white matter integrity, critical illness and major infection were associated with smaller brain volume, particularly within regions implicated in AD. © 2018, Copyright the Author Journal compilation © 2018, The American Geriatrics Society","Alzheimer's disease; dementia; magnetic resonance imaging; risk factor","Adult; Aged; Brain; Communicable Diseases; Critical Illness; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Prospective Studies; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; White Matter; adult; aged; brain; communicable disease; critical illness; diagnostic imaging; diffusion tensor imaging; female; hospitalization; human; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; procedures; prospective study; regression analysis; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; white matter","K.A.

More than a third of RBD patients have mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but their specific structural brain alterations remain poorly understood. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the local deformation and volume of gray and white matter tissue underlying MCI in RBD. Methods: Fifty-two idiopathic RBD patients, including 17 with MCI (33%), underwent polysomnography, neuropsychological, neurological, and magnetic resonance imaging assessments. MCI diagnosis was based on a subjective complaint, cognitive impairment on the neuropsychological battery, and preserved daily functioning. Forty-one controls were also included. Deformation-based morphometry (DBM), voxel-based morphometry (VBM), and regional volume analyses of the corpus callosum and cholinergic basal forebrain were performed. Multiple regression models were also computed using anatomical, cognitive (composite z scores), and motor parameters. Results: Globally, patients with MCI displayed a widespread pattern of local deformation and volume atrophy in the cortical (bilateral insula, cingulate cortex, precuneus, frontal, temporal and occipital regions, right angular gyrus, and mid-posterior segment of the corpus callosum) and subcortical (brainstem, corona radiata, basal ganglia, thalamus, amygdala, and right hippocampus) regions compared to patients without MCI (DBM) or controls (DBM and VBM). Moreover, brain deformation (DBM) in patients were associated with lower performance in attention and executive functions, visuospatial abilities, and higher motor symptoms severity. Conclusion: The present study identified novel brain structural alterations in RBD patients with MCI which correlated with poorer cognitive performance. These results are consistent with those reported in patients with synucleinopathies-related cognitive impairment. © 2022 - IOS Press.

While there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD), early diagnosis and accurate prognosis of AD may enable or encourage lifestyle changes, neurocognitive enrichment, and interventions to slow the rate of cognitive decline. The goal of our study was to develop and evaluate a novel deep learning algorithm to predict mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD conversion at three years after diagnosis using longitudinal and whole-brain 3D MRI. Methods. This retrospective study consisted of 320 normal cognition (NC), 554 MCI, and 237 AD patients. Longitudinal data include T1-weighted 3D MRI obtained at initial presentation with diagnosis of MCI and at 12-month follow up. Whole-brain 3D MRI volumes were used without a priori segmentation of regional structural volumes or cortical thicknesses. MRIs of the AD and NC cohort were used to train a deep learning classification model to obtain weights to be applied via transfer learning for prediction of MCI patient conversion to AD at three years post-diagnosis. Two (zero-shot and fine tuning) transfer learning methods were evaluated. Three different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (sequential, residual bottleneck, and wide residual) were compared. Data were split into 75% and 25% for training and testing, respectively, with 4-fold cross validation. Prediction accuracy was evaluated using balanced accuracy. Heatmaps were generated. Results. The sequential convolutional approach yielded slightly better performance than the residual-based architecture, the zero-shot transfer learning approach yielded better performance than fine tuning, and CNN using longitudinal data performed better than CNN using a single timepoint MRI in predicting MCI conversion to AD. The best CNN model for predicting MCI conversion to AD at three years after diagnosis yielded a balanced accuracy of 0.793. Heatmaps of the prediction model showed regions most relevant to the network including the lateral ventricles, periventricular white matter and cortical gray matter. Conclusions. This is the first convolutional neural network model using longitudinal and whole-brain 3D MRIs without extracting regional brain volumes or cortical thicknesses to predict future MCI to AD conversion at 3 years after diagnosis. This approach could lead to early prediction of patients who are likely to progress to AD and thus may lead to better management of the disease.

This is typically done by applying convolutional neural networks to slices of a 3D brain image volume. Each slice of the brain volume, however, represents only a small cross-sectional area of the cortical layer. On the other hand, convolutional neural networks are less well developed for 3D volumes. Therefore we sought to apply deep networks to the 2D cortical surface, for the purpose of classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is known to affect the thickness and geometry of the cortical surface of the brain. Although the cortical surface has a complex geometry, here we present a novel data processing method to feed the information of an entire cortical surface into existing deep networks for more accurate early disease detection. A brain 3D MRI volume is registered and its cortical surface is flattened to a 2D plane. The flattened distributions of the thickness, curvature and surface area are combined into an RBG image which can be readily fed to existing deep networks. In this paper, the ADNI dataset of brain MRI scans are used and flattened cortical images are applied to different deep networks including ResNet and Inception. Two pre-clinical stages of AD are considered; stable mild cognitive impairment (MCIs) and converting mild cognitive impairment (MCIc). Experiments show that using flattened cortical images consistently leads to higher accuracy compared to using brain slices with the same network architecture. Specifically, the highest accuracy of 81% is achieved by Inception with flattened cortical images, as compared to 68% by the same network on brain slices and 75.9% accuracy by the best method in the literature which also used a deep network on brain slices. Our results indicate that flattened cortical images can be used to learn and classify AD with high accuracy. © 2018 IEEE.","CNN; Cortical thickness sheet; Inception; MCI; MRI; ResNet; Transfer Learning","Brain mapping; Convolution; Data handling; Deep learning; Magnetic resonance imaging; Network architecture; Neural networks; Neurodegenerative diseases; Convolutional neural network; Cortical thickness; Data processing methods; Early disease detection; Inception; Mild cognitive impairments; ResNet; Transfer learning; Brain","","Pickering M.; Zheng L.; You S.; Rahman A.; Murshed M.; Asikuzzaman M.; Natu A.; Robles-Kelly A.; Paul M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-153866602-9","","","English","Int.

BRAIM can be used for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson, Alzheimer or Multiple Sclerosis and also for brain lesion diagnosis and monitoring. Methods The developed CAD system includes different user-friendly tools for segmenting and determining whole brain and brain structure volumes in an easy and accurate way. Specifically, three types of measurements can be performed: (1) total volume of white, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid; (2) brain structure volumes (volume of putamen, thalamus, hippocampus and caudate nucleus); and (3) brain lesion volumes. Results As a proof of concept, some study cases were analyzed with the presented system achieving promising results. In addition to be used to quantify treatment effectiveness in patients with brain lesions, it was demonstrated that BRAIM is able to classify a subject according to the brain volume measurements using as reference a healthy control database created for this purpose. Conclusions The CAD system presented in this paper simplifies the daily work of clinicians and provides them with objective and quantitative volume data for prospective and retrospective analyses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Brain lesions; Brain segmentation; CAD; Magnetic resonance imaging; Volumetric analysis","Brain; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Organ Size; Brain; Cerebrospinal fluid; Classification (of information); Computer aided analysis; Computer aided design; Diagnosis; Image processing; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Patient treatment; Volumetric analysis; Brain lesions; Brain segmentation; Computer aided diagnosis systems; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Multiple sclerosis; Retrospective analysis; Treatment monitoring; User-friendly tool; adult; aged; Article; braim software; brain damage; brain size; caudate nucleus; cerebrospinal fluid; computer aided design; computer interface; degenerative disease; early diagnosis; female; gray matter; hippocampus; human; image analysis; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; putamen; software; thalamus; volumetry; white matter; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; degenerative disease; diagnostic imaging; image processing; organ size; pathology; Computer aided diagnosis","S.

To use atrophy rate as a reliable clinical biomarker and to increase statistical power in clinical treatment trials, measurement variability needs to be minimized. Among other sources, systematic differences between different MR scanners are suspected to contribute to this variability. In this study we developed and performed initial validation tests of an MR-compatible phantom and analysis software for robust and reliable evaluation of the brain volume loss. The phantom contained three inflatable models of brain structures, i.e. cerebral hemisphere, putamen, and caudate nucleus. Software to reliably quantify volumes form the phantom images was also developed. To validate the method, the phantom was imaged using 3D T1-weighted protocols at three clinical 3T MR scanners from different vendors. Calculated volume change from MRI was compared with the known applied volume change using ICC and mean absolute difference. As assessed by the ICC, the agreement between our developed software and the applied volume change for different structures ranged from 0.999–1 for hemisphere, 0.976–0.998 for putamen, and 0.985–0.999 for caudate nucleus. The mean absolute differences between measured and applied volume change were 109–332 μL for hemisphere, 2.9–11.9 μL for putamen, and 2.2–10.1 μL for caudate nucleus. This method offers a reliable and robust measurement of volume change using MR images and could potentially be used to standardize clinical measurement of atrophy rates. © 2019 The Authors","Brain atrophy; MRI; Phantom; Segmentation; Standardization","Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Brain; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multiple Sclerosis; Phantoms, Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Article; brain atrophy; brain size; caudate nucleus; hemisphere; image analysis; image segmentation; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; putamen; validation study; Alzheimer disease; atrophy; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; human; imaging phantom; multiple sclerosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; software","H.

In order to improve the comparability between studies and aid future analytical software platform choice in the research setting, here we compare two segmentation pipelines of structural brain magnetic resonance imaging(sMRI): the SPM12 toolbox, and a SPM12 add-on, the CAT12 toolbox. Methods: We segmented 1.5T and 3T T1-weighted sMRI images (from the OASIS-brain database) using both pipelines and compared them in terms of their impact on: 1)the effect of age on the total grey matter(GM) and white matter(WM), and on the hippocampi GM volumes in a healthy sample(n = 238); 2)the effect of AD diagnosis on the same volume measures; and 3)the accuracy of each volume measure detecting diagnosis (100 patients with AD and 78 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects). Results and comparison between methods: Our results demonstrated that: 1)volume estimates from SPM12 were highly correlated with the ones from CAT12, albeit absolute differences between pipelines were tissue specific; 2)the choice of pipeline modulated the effect of age on all volume measures and of diagnosis on hippocampi GM volumes computed from 3 T data; and 3)pipeline had no impact on the accuracy of any brain volume measure detecting AD diagnosis. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that other studies should take these pipeline effects on age and AD diagnosis, into account, for improved comparability in previous literature. Additionally, we encourage future studies to use CAT12 as this is a more advanced and computationally efficient brain segmentation tool. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aging; Alzheimer's disease diagnosis; Biomarker; Brain tissue segmentation; CAT12; SPM12","adult; age; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain size; controlled study; female; gray matter; hippocampus; human; image segmentation; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; tissue specificity; white matter","V.

Carlson Center for Imaging Science, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, United States","Background and Purpose: Total brain volume and total intracranial volume are important measures for assessing whole-brain atrophy in Alzheimer disease, dementia, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Unlike MR imaging, which has a number of well-validated fully-automated methods, only a handful of methods segment CT images. Available methods either use enhanced CT, do not estimate both volumes, or require formal validation. Reliable computation of total brain volume and total intracranial volume from CT is needed because head CTs are more widely used than head MRIs in the clinical setting. We present an automated head CT segmentation method (CTseg) to estimate total brain volume and total intracranial volume. Materials and Methods: CTseg adapts a widely used brain MR imaging segmentation method from the Statistical Parametric Mapping toolbox using a CT-based template for initial registration. CTseg was tested and validated using head CT images from a clinical archive. Results: CTseg showed excellent agreement with 20 manually segmented head CTs. The intraclass correlation was 0.97 (P, <001) for total intracranial volume and 0.94 (P, <001) for total brain volume. When CTseg was applied to a cross-sectional Alzheimer disease dataset (58 with Alzheimer disease patients and 58 matched controls), CTseg detected a loss in percentage total brain volume (as a percentage of total intracranial volume) with age (P,<001) as well as a group difference between patients with Alzheimer disease and controls (P,<01). We observed similar results when total brain volume was modeled with total intracranial volume as a confounding variable. Conclusions: In current clinical practice, brain atrophy is assessed by inaccurate and subjective ""eyeballing"" of CT images. Manual segmentation of head CT images is prohibitively arduous and time-consuming. CTseg can potentially help clinicians to automatically measure total brain volume and detect and track atrophy in neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, CTseg can be applied to large clinical archives for a variety of research studies. © 2020 American Society of Neuroradiology.

Methods: 3T brain MRI data were analyzed with VBM in 22 sCJD participants and 26 age-matched controls. Analyses included relationships of regional brain volumes with major clinical variables and dichotomization of the cohort according to expected disease duration based on prion molecular classification (i.e., short-duration/Fast-progressors (MM1, MV1, and VV2) vs. long-duration/Slow-progressors (MV2, VV1, and MM2)). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess network-level interactions of atrophy between specific brain regions. Results: sCJD showed selective atrophy in cortical and subcortical regions overlapping with all but one region of the default mode network (DMN) and the insulae, thalami, and right occipital lobe. SEM showed that the effective connectivity model fit in sCJD but not controls. The presence of visual hallucinations correlated with right fusiform, bilateral thalami, and medial orbitofrontal atrophy. Interestingly, brain atrophy was present in both Fast- and Slow-progressors. Worse cognition was associated with bilateral mesial frontal, insular, temporal pole, thalamus, and cerebellum atrophy. Interpretation: Brain atrophy in sCJD preferentially affects specific cortical and subcortical regions, with an effective connectivity model showing strength and directionality between regions. Brain atrophy is present in Fast- and Slow-progressors, correlates with clinical findings, and is a potential biomarker in sCJD. © 2021 The Authors.

Segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR) brain images is also an important pre-processing step, since many neural disorders are associated with brain’s volume changes. As a result, brain image segmentation can be considered as an essential measure toward automated diagnosis or interpretation of regions of interest, which can help surgical planning, analyzing changes of brain’s volume in different tissue types, and identifying neural disorders. In many neural disorders such as Alzheimer and epilepsy, determining the volume of different brain tissues (i.e., white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluids) has been proven to be effective in quantifying diseases. A traditional way for segmenting brain images involves the use of a medical expert’s experience in manually determining the boundary of different regions of interest in brain images. It may seem that manual segmentation of MR brain images by an expert is the first and the best choice. However, this method is proved to be time-consuming and challenging. Hence, numerous MR brain image segmentation methods with different degrees of complexity and accuracy have been introduced recently. Our work proposes an optimized thresholding method for segmentation of MR brain images using biologically inspired ant colony algorithm. In this proposed algorithm, textural features are adopted as heuristic information. Besides, post-processing image enhancement based on homogeneity is also performed to achieve a better performance. The empirical results on axial T1-weighted MR brain images have demonstrated competitive accuracy to traditional meta-heuristic methods, K-means, and expectation maximization. © 2018, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.","Ant colony optimization; Meta-heuristic algorithms; MR brain images; Multilevel thresholding; Segmentation; Textural feature","Brain; Brain Diseases; Brain Mapping; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Ant colony optimization; Brain; Brain mapping; Cerebrospinal fluid; Diagnosis; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Image enhancement; Magnetic resonance; Maximum principle; Tissue; Brain images; Expectation - maximizations; Image processing applications; Meta heuristic algorithm; Meta-heuristic methods; MR brain image segmentation; Multilevel thresholding; Textural feature; brain; brain disease; brain mapping; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; Image segmentation","M.

Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs18000795) within the promoter region of interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene was earlier noted to have a differential susceptibility on hippocampal volume in schizophrenia (SCZ). Materials and Methods: We examined antipsychotic-naïve/free SCZ patients (n = 35) in comparison with healthy controls (n = 68). Hippocampus volumes were assessed in 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging using voxel-based morphometry. Region of interest analysis was done using hippocampus mask. IL-6 SNP (rs1800795) was genotyped using TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. Results: A significantly deficient right (T = 3.03; KE= 392; PSVC-FWE= 0.04) and left (T = 3.03; KE= 47; Puncorr= 0.03) hippocampal gray matter volumes were noted in SCZ patients after controlling for the potential confounding effects of age, sex, and total brain volume. There was a significant diagnosis x rs1800795 genotype interaction involving both left (T = 2.17, KE= 95, Puncorr= 0.02) and right (T = 1.82, KE= 29, Puncorr= 0.04) hippocampal volumes. Patients with GG (left: F =5.78; P = 0.02; right: F =6.21; P = 0.01) but not GC/CC genotype (left: F =0.89; P = 0.34; right: F <0.01; P = 0.95) had volume depletion. Conclusion: A paradoxical smaller hippocampal volume with GG genotype was noted in SCZ.

Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients and eighteen age-matched normal controls (NCs) underwent MR examination. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores were obtained from all patients. The whole brain volumetric characteristics, T1, T2, and proton density (PD) values of different cortical and subcortical regions were obtained. The volumetric characteristics and brain regional relaxation values between AD patients and NCs were compared using independent-samples t-test. The correlations between these quantitative parameters and MMSE score were assessed by the Pearson correlation in AD patients. Results: Although the larger volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), lower brain parenchymal volume (BPV), and the ratio of brain parenchymal volume to intracranial volume (BPV/ICV) were found in AD patients compared with NCs, there were no significant differences (p > 0.05). T1 values of right insula cortex and T2 values of left hippocampus and right insula cortex were significantly higher in AD patients than in NCs, but T1 values of left caudate showed a reverse trend (p < 0.05). As the MMSE score decreased in AD patients, the BPV and BPV/ICV decreased, while the volume of CSF and T1 values of bilateral insula cortex and bilateral hippocampus as well as T2 values of bilateral hippocampus increased (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Synthetic MRI not only provides more information to differentiate AD patients from normal controls, but also reflects the disease severity of AD. © Copyright © 2021 Lou, Jiang, Li, Wu, Li, Qin, Chen, Wang, Wu and Chen.","Alzheimer’s disease; brain volume; cognitive function; CSF volume; multiparametric MRI; neurodegenerative disease","adult; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain cortex; brain size; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease severity; female; hippocampus; human; image analysis; image processing; insula; male; Mini Mental State Examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quantitative analysis","M.

The sensitive period for risk exposure and extent that risk is mediated through amyloid or vascular-related mechanisms are poorly understood. We aimed to identify if, and when, blood pressure or change in blood pressure during adulthood were associated with late-life brain structure, pathology, and cognition. Methods: Participants were from Insight 46, a neuroscience substudy of the ongoing longitudinal Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, a birth cohort that initially comprised 5362 individuals born throughout mainland Britain in one week in 1946. Participants aged 69–71 years received T1 and FLAIR volumetric MRI, florbetapir amyloid-PET imaging, and cognitive assessment at University College London (London, UK); all participants were dementia-free. Blood pressure measurements had been collected at ages 36, 43, 53, 60–64, and 69 years. We also calculated blood pressure change variables between ages. Primary outcome measures were white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) quantified from multimodal MRI using an automated method, amyloid-β positivity or negativity using a standardised uptake value ratio approach, whole-brain and hippocampal volumes quantified from 3D-T1 MRI, and a composite cognitive score—the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC). We investigated associations between blood pressure and blood pressure changes at and between 36, 43, 53, 60–64, and 69 years of age with WMHV using generalised linear models with a gamma distribution and log link function, amyloid-β status using logistic regression, whole-brain volume and hippocampal volumes using linear regression, and PACC score using linear regression, with adjustment for potential confounders. Findings: Between May 28, 2015, and Jan 10, 2018, 502 individuals were assessed as part of Insight 46. 465 participants (238 [51%] men; mean age 70·7 years [SD 0·7]; 83 [18%] amyloid-β-positive) were included in imaging analyses. Higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at age 53 years and greater increases in SBP and DBP between 43 and 53 years were positively associated with WMHV at 69–71 years of age (increase in mean WMHV per 10 mm Hg greater SBP 7%, 95% CI 1–14, p=0·024; increase in mean WMHV per 10 mm Hg greater DBP 15%, 4–27, p=0·0057; increase in mean WMHV per one SD change in SBP 15%, 3–29, p=0·012; increase in mean WMHV per 1 SD change in DBP 15%, 3–30, p=0·017). Higher DBP at 43 years of age was associated with smaller whole-brain volume at 69–71 years of age (−6·9 mL per 10 mm Hg greater DBP, −11·9 to −1·9, p=0·0068), as were greater increases in DBP between 36 and 43 years of age (−6·5 mL per 1 SD change, −11·1 to −1·9, p=0·0054). Greater increases in SBP between 36 and 43 years of age were associated with smaller hippocampal volumes at 69–71 years of age (−0·03 mL per 1 SD change, −0·06 to −0·001, p=0·043). Neither absolute blood pressure nor change in blood pressure predicted amyloid-β status or PACC score at 69–71 years of age. Interpretation: High and increasing blood pressure from early adulthood into midlife seems to be associated with increased WMHV and smaller brain volumes at 69–71 years of age. We found no evidence that blood pressure affected cognition or cerebral amyloid-β load at this age. Blood pressure monitoring and interventions might need to start around 40 years of age to maximise late-life brain health.

The correlation between shrinking of the brain shape and decreasing volume also affects the change in texture shape. In this proposed study, a new feature descriptor called the Histogram of Oriented Gradients from Three Orthogonal of Planes (HOG-TOP) is proposed to extract the dynamic texture features of 3D MRI brain images. The extension of the local binary pattern is the complete local binary pattern of sign magnitude (CLBPSM) as a feature extraction method also introduced. Because the features were in a high dimensional space, then probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) is used as one method of dimensionality reduction method. Furthermore, the random forest classifier is used for binary classification of Alzheimer's, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and normal. In the experimental results show that the 3D HOG-TOP features provide the highest sensitivity value compared to CLBPSM-TOP and hybrid feature for all classifications. © 2018 IEEE.","Alzheimer's disease; HOG-TOP; MRI images; texture feature","Brain mapping; Computer aided diagnosis; Decision trees; Image classification; Image texture; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Principal component analysis; Shrinkage; Alzheimer's disease; Dimensionality reduction method; Histogram of oriented gradients; HOG-TOP; Mild cognitive impairments (MCI); MRI Image; Probabilistic principal component analysis; Texture features; Classification (of information)","D.

Previous meta-Analyses have typically focused on a single diagnosis, thereby precluding transdiagnostic comparisons. Methods and analysis We will include all structural MRI studies of adults that report brain volumes for participants from at least two of the following diagnostic groups: healthy controls, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, psychotic depression, clinical high risk for psychosis, schizotypal personality disorder, psychosis unspecified, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-Traumatic stress disorder, emotionally unstable personality disorder, 22q11 deletion syndrome, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, mixed anxiety and depression. Network meta-Analysis will be used to synthesise eligible studies. The primary analysis will examine standardised mean difference in average volume, a secondary analysis will examine differences in variability of volumes. Discussion This network meta-Analysis will provide a transdiagnostic integration of structural neuroimaging studies, providing researchers with a valuable summary of a large literature.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the most popular technique to study the functional activation patterns of the brain. The fMRI data is four-dimensional, composed of 3D brain images over time. Each voxel of the 3D brain volume is associated with a time series of signal intensity values. This study aimed to identify the distinct voxels from time-series fMRI data that show high functional activation during a task. Methods: In this study, a novel mean-deviation based approach was applied to time-series fMRI data of 34 schizophrenia patients and 34 healthy subjects. The statistical measures such as mean and median were used to find the functional changes in each voxel over time. The voxels that show significant changes for each subject were selected and thus used as the feature set during the classification of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Results: The proposed approach identifies a set of relevant voxels that are used to distinguish between healthy and schizophrenia subjects with high classification accuracy. The study shows functional changes in brain regions such as superior frontal gyrus, cuneus, medial frontal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus. Conclusions: This work describes a simple yet novel feature selection algorithm for time-series fMRI data to identify the activated brain voxels that are generally affected in schizophrenia. The brain regions identified in this study may further help clinicians to understand the illness for better medical intervention. It may be possible to explore the approach to fMRI data of other psychological disorders. © 2018 Chatterjee I.","Classification; FMRI; Schizophrenia; Time-series","adult; Article; brain function; brain region; classification algorithm; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; cuneus; diagnostic accuracy; disease classification; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; intervention study; male; mental disease; middle frontal gyrus; middle occipital gyrus; schizophrenia; superior frontal gyrus; superior temporal gyrus; time series analysis; voxel based morphometry","I.

Objective: To examine if incipient mixed dementia can be differentiated from incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) and subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SVD) using neuropsychological tests, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers, and magnetic resonance imaging markers. Methods: We included 493 patients and controls from the Gothenburg MCI study and used the dementia groups for marker selection (CSF total-tau (T-tau), phospho-tau (P-tau), and amyloid-β42 (Aβ42), 11 neuropsychological tests, and 92 regional brain volumes) and to obtain cut-off values which were then applied to the MCI groups. Results: Incipient mixed dementia was best differentiated from incipient AD by the Word fluency F-A-S test and the Trail making test A. CSF T-tau, P-tau, and Aβ42 differentiated incipient mixed dementia from incipient SVD. Conclusion: Incipient mixed dementia is characterized by an AD-like biomarker profile and an SVD-like cognitive profile. Incipient mixed dementia can be separated from incipient AD and incipient SVD using CSF markers and cognitive testing. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

This disease causes cell death and nerve tissue damage in the brain. The brain damage can be detected using brain volume, whole brain form, and genetic testing. In this research, we propose texture analysis of the brain and genomic analysis to detect Alzheimer's disease. 3D MRI images were chosen to analyze the texture of the brain, and microarray data were chosen to analyze gene expression. We classified Alzheimer's disease into three types: Alzheimer's, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Normal. In this study, texture analysis was carried out by using the Advanced Local Binary Pattern (ALBP) and the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). We also propose the bi-clustering method to analyze microarray data. The experimental results from texture analysis show that ALBP had better performance than GLCM in classification of Alzheimer's disease. The ALBP method achieved an average value of accuracy of between 75%-100% for binary classification of the whole brain data. Furthermore, Biclustering method with microarray data shows good performance gene expression, where this information show influence Alzheimer's disease with total of bi-cluster is 6. © 2018 Alhadi Bustamam et al., published by De Gruyter Open.","Alzheimer's Disease; Bi-Clustering; Feature Extraction; Local Binary Pattern (LBP); MRI","","","","De Gruyter Open Ltd","24496499","","","","English","J.

A support-vector machine (SVM) is one of the machine learning techniques, which may be utilized as a classifier for various classification problems. This study exploratorily investigated the accuracy of SVM classification models for AD subjects using brain volume and various clinical data as features. Methods: The study was designed as a retrospective chart review. A total of 201 eligible subjects were recruited from the Memory Clinic at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand. Eighteen cases were excluded due to incomplete MRI data. Subjects were randomly assigned to a training group (AD = 46, normal = 46) and testing group (AD = 45, normal = 46) for SVM modeling and validation, respectively. The results in terms of accuracy and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis are reported. Results: The highest accuracy for brain volumetry (62.64%) was found using the hippocampus as a single feature. A combination of clinical parameters as features provided accuracy ranging between 83 and 90%. However, a combination of brain volumetry and clinical parameters as features to the SVM models did not improve the accuracy of the result. Conclusions: In our study, the use of brain volumetry as SVM features provided low classification accuracy with the highest accuracy of 62.64% using the hippocampus volume alone. In contrast, the use of clinical parameters [Thai mental state examination score, controlled oral word association tests (animals; and letters K, S, and P), learning memory, clock-drawing test, and construction-praxis] as features for SVM models provided good accuracy between 83 and 90%. © Copyright © 2021 Vichianin, Khummongkol, Chiewvit, Raksthaput, Chaichanettee, Aoonkaew and Senanarong.","Alzheimer disease; machine learning; support vector machine; Thailand; volumetric MRI","aged; Alzheimer disease; amygdala; Article; brain size; brain ventricle; caudate nucleus; controlled oral word association test; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; gray matter; hippocampus; human; learning; major clinical study; male; medical record review; memory; Mini Mental State Examination; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nucleus accumbens; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; Thailand; thalamus; volumetry; white matter","V.

There is debate as to whether it is a different condition or a variant of essential tremor (ET), or even, if both conditions coexist. Our objective was to use data mining classification methods, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived brain volume and cortical thickness data, to identify morphometric measures that help to discriminate OT patients from those with ET. Methods: MRI-derived brain volume and cortical thickness were obtained from 14 OT patients and 15 age-, sex-, and education-matched ET patients. Feature selection and machine learning methods were subsequently applied. Results: Four MRI features alone distinguished the two, OT from ET, with 100% diagnostic accuracy. More specifically, left thalamus proper volume (normalized by the total intracranial volume), right superior parietal volume, right superior parietal thickness, and right inferior parietal roughness (i.e., the standard deviation of cortical thickness) were shown to play a key role in OT and ET characterization. Finally, the left caudal anterior cingulate thickness and the left caudal middle frontal roughness allowed us to separate with 100% diagnostic accuracy subgroups of OT patients (primary and those with mild parkinsonian signs). Conclusions: A data mining approach applied to MRI-derived brain volume and cortical thickness data may differentiate between these two types of tremor with an accuracy of 100%. Our results suggest that OT and ET are distinct conditions. © 2019 The Authors.

However, previous studies of the aging brain have mostly focused on Caucasians, not East Asians. The aim of this paper was to examine ethnic differences in the aging process of brain structures or to determine to what extent ethnicity affects the normative values of lobar and subcortical volumes in clinically normal elderly and the diagnosis in multi-racial patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lobar and subcortical volumes were measured using FreeSurfer from MRI data of 1,686 normal Koreans (age range 59–89) and 851 Caucasian, non-Hispanic subjects in the ADNI and OASIS datasets. The regression models were designed to predict brain volumes, including ethnicity, age, sex, intracranial volume (ICV), magnetic field strength (MFS), and MRI scanner manufacturers as independent variables. Ethnicity had a significant effect for all lobar (|β| > 0.20, p < 0.001) and subcortical regions (|β| > 0.08, p < 0.001) except left pallidus and bilateral ventricles. To demonstrate the validity of the z-score for AD diagnosis, 420 patients and 420 normal controls were selected evenly from the Korean and Caucasian datasets. The four validation groups divided by race and diagnosis were matched on age and sex using a propensity score matching. We analyzed whether and to what extent the ethnicity adjustment improved the diagnostic power of the logistic regression model that was built using the only z-scores of six regions: bilateral temporal cortices, hippocampi, and amygdalae. The performance of the classifier after ethnicity adjustment was significantly improved compared with the classifier before ethnicity adjustment (ΔAUC = 0.10, D = 7.80, p < 0.001; AUC comparison test using bootstrap). Korean AD dementia patients may not be classified by Caucasian norms of brain volumes because the brain regions vulnerable to AD dementia are bigger in normal Korean elderly peoples. Therefore, ethnicity is an essential factor in establishing normative data for regional volumes in brain aging and applying it to the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. © Copyright © 2021 Choi, Lee, Choi, Choi, Seo, Choo, Kim, Song, Choi, Cho, Choe, Kim and Lee.","aging; Alzheimer's disease; brain magnetic resonance imaging; ethnic difference; norm","","K.H.

Behavioral changes over the course of healthy ageing, at disease onset and during disease progression, have been recently put forward as promising markers for the detection of MCI and AD. The present study examines whether the temporal characteristics of speech in a collaborative referencing task are associated with cognitive function and the volumes of brain regions involved in speech production and known to be reduced in MCI and AD pathology. We then explore the discriminative ability of the temporal speech measures for the classification of MCI and AD. Method: Individuals with MCI, mild-to-moderate AD and healthy controls (HCs) underwent a structural MRI scan and a battery of neuropsychological tests. They also engaged in a collaborative referencing task with a caregiver. The associations between the conversational speech timing features, cognitive function (domain-specific) and regional brain volumes were examined by means of linear mixed-effect modeling. Genetic programming was used to explore the discriminative ability of the conversational speech features. Results: MCI and mild-to-moderate AD are characterized by a general slowness of speech, attributed to slower speech rate and slower turn-taking in conversational settings. The speech characteristics appear to be reflective of episodic, lexico-semantic, executive functioning and visuospatial deficits and underlying volume reductions in frontal, temporal and cerebellar areas. Conclusion: The implementation of conversational speech timing-based technologies in clinical and community settings may provide additional markers for the early detection of cognitive deficits and structural changes associated with MCI and AD. © Copyright © 2021 De Looze, Dehsarvi, Crosby, Vourdanou, Coen, Lawlor and Reilly.","Alzheimer; brain volumes; cognitive function; conversation; speech timing","adult; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain size; caregiver; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; early diagnosis; episodic memory; female; human; male; middle aged; mild cognitive impairment; neuropsychological test; speech","C.

Purpose: To investigate the association between lesion detection and the processes used in creating DARTEL template in group comparisons with voxel-based morphometry. Material and Methods: Three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI data of 31 healthy controls, 31 patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and 31 patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus were obtained using a 3-T magnetic resonance scanner. Segmented gray matter images were then deformed into three types of DARTEL templates using the Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 software. Results: Processes 1 (DARTEL template with all individuals) and 2 (DARTEL template with healthy controls) showed significant lesions, as observed in previous reports, whereas process 3 (DARTEL template with individuals divided into two groups) showed significantly larger lesions than those noted with processes 1 and 2. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that lesion detection depends on the processes used in the creation of the DARTEL template. © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2019.","Alzheimer’s disease; DARTEL; idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus; normalization; voxel-based morphometry","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Algebra; Alzheimer; DARTEL; Normal pressure hydrocephalus; normalization; Voxel-based morphometry; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain size; controlled study; diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra; female; gray matter; human; image processing; image registration algorithm; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; normotensive hydrocephalus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; very elderly; voxel based morphometry; Alzheimer disease; brain; brain mapping; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; procedures; three-dimensional imaging; Magnetic resonance","M.

This manuscript evaluates the degree to which biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, (AD) neuropathology and longitudinal changes in brain structure, account for age-related differences in cognition. Data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 1012) were analyzed, including individuals with normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment. Parallel process mixed effects regression models characterized longitudinal trajectories of cognitive variables and time-varying changes in brain volumes. Baseline age was associated with both memory and executive function at baseline (p's < 0.001) and change in memory and executive function performances over time (p's < 0.05). After adjusting for clinical diagnosis, baseline, and longitudinal changes in brain volume, and baseline levels of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, age effects on change in episodic memory and executive function were fully attenuated, age effects on baseline memory were substantially attenuated, but an association remained between age and baseline executive function. Results support previous studies that show that age effects on cognitive decline are fully mediated by disease and neurodegeneration variables but also show domain-specific age effects on baseline cognition, specifically an age pathway to executive function that is independent of brain and disease pathways. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Cognition; CSF biomarkers; Longitudinal modeling; MRI; Parallel process model; Structural imaging","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Brain; Cognitive Aging; Cognitive Dysfunction; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory; Models, Statistical; Nerve Degeneration; Neuroimaging; Organ Size; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; biological marker; tau protein; biological marker; age; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain size; cerebrospinal fluid; cognition; cognitive decline; cognitive defect; controlled study; episodic memory; executive function; female; human; major clinical study; male; memory; mild cognitive impairment; nerve degeneration; priority journal; aging; Alzheimer disease; brain; cognitive aging; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; psychology; statistical model; very elderly","T.J.

Hence, we assessed GM volume reductions in patients with schizophrenia using 3 T magnetic resonace imaging to replicate results across two independent and culturally different backgrounds (Germany, Japan), and to investigate the impact of brain volume reductions on clinical characteristics. In total, 163 German (80 patients) and 203 Japanese (83 patients) participants were included in the analysis. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to investigate structural differences between the groups and across the two sites, comparing local GM volumes. Clinical variables were used to analyze effects unrelated to the socio-cultural background. Across both data sets, widespread GM reductions in frontal and temporal cortical parts were found between patients and controls, indicating strong effects of diagnosis and only small effects of site. The investigation of clinical characteristics revealed the strongest effects for chlorpromazine equivalents on GM volume reductions primarily in the Japanese sample. Although the effects of site are small, several brain regions do not overlap between the two groups. Thus, GM may be affected differently at the two sites in patients with schizophrenia. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cortical gray matter; Cross-cultural replication; Germany; Japan; Psychosis; Voxel-based morphometry","Adult; Cerebral Cortex; Cross-Sectional Studies; Culture; Female; Germany; Gray Matter; Humans; Japan; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; chlorpromazine; adult; Article; brain size; female; German (citizen); gray matter; human; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; replication study; schizophrenia; social class; voxel based morphometry; brain cortex; cross-sectional study; cultural anthropology; diagnostic imaging; ethnology; Germany; gray matter; Japan; middle aged; organ size; procedures; psychology; schizophrenia","K.

Our proposed approach uses the improved brain extraction mask from BEaST (Brain Extraction based on nonlocal Segmentation Technique) instead of the conventional BET (Brain Extraction Tool) for SIENA. We compared four varying options of BET as well as BEaST and applied these five methods to analyze scan-rescan MRIs in ADNI from 332 subjects, longitudinal ADNI MRIs from the same 332 subjects, their repeat scans over time, and OASIS longitudinal MRIs from 123 subjects. The results showed that BEaST brain masks were consistent in scan-rescan reproducibility. The cross-sectional scan-rescan error in the absolute percent brain volume difference measured by SIENA was smallest (p0.0187) with the proposed BEaST-SIENA. We evaluated the statistical power in terms of effect size, and the best performance was achieved with BEaST-SIENA (1.2789 for ADNI and 1.095 for OASIS). The absolute difference in PBVC between scan-dataset (volume change from baseline to year-1) and rescan-dataset (volume change from baseline repeat scan to year-1 repeat scan) was also the smallest with BEaST-SIENA compared to the BET-based SIENA and had the highest correlation when compared to the BET-based SIENA variants. In conclusion, our study shows that BEaST was robust in terms of reproducibility and consistency and that SIENA’s reproducibility and statistical power are improved in multiple datasets when used in combination with BEaST. © 2018 Nakamura et al.

We have analyzed the effects of different methods of hippocampal volume (HV) adjustment on the diagnostic accuracy of this technique. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of 148 subjects of the ADNI database (48 normal, 66 MCI, 34 AD). Brain volumes were calculated from 3T MRI scans with gm extractor, a fully automated script based on FSL. A series of logistic regression models was obtained using 9 volumes of reference and 3 methods of adjustment (normalization, covariance, bilinear regression). Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic curve method. External validity was assessed with 10-fold cross-validation. Results: The models with the highest area under the curve (AUC) were those including the HV normalized by total intracranial volume (TIV). The differences with bilinear regression and the covariance method adjusted by TIV were minor and not statistically significant. The lowest AUCs corresponded to the models based on raw (unadjusted) HVs. The results were qualitatively similar in two clinical settings (normal versus MCI, and normal versus AD), but the differences were higher in the normal versus MCI context. Conclusion: The accuracy of hippocampal volumetry for the differential diagnosis between normal subjects and patients with MCI or AD was maximized by normalizing the HV by the TIV. Our results do not exclude the potential superiority of non-linear models. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Alzheimer disease (MeSH); Bilinear regression; Covariance; Hippocampal volumetry; Mild cognitive impairment; Normalization","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Logistic Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Organ Size; Sensitivity and Specificity; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain region; brain size; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; clinical practice; comparative study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; hippocampus; human; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; receiver operating characteristic; Alzheimer disease; cognitive defect; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; hippocampus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model","A.

Methods:In this longitudinal analysis, we use a data-driven approach clustering PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (n = 314, age 61.0 ± 9.5, years 34.1% female, 5 years of follow-up). Voxel-level neuroanatomic features were estimated with deformation-based morphometry (DBM) of T1-weighted MRI. Voxels with deformation values that were significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with clinical scores (Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Parts I-III and total score, tremor score, and postural instability and gait difficulty score) at baseline were selected. Then, these neuroanatomic features were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis. Changes in the longitudinal progression and neuroanatomic pattern were compared between different biotypes. Results:Two neuroanatomic biotypes were identified: biotype 1 (n = 114) with subcortical brain volumes smaller than heathy controls and biotype 2 (n = 200) with subcortical brain volumes larger than heathy controls. Biotype 1 had more severe motor impairment, autonomic dysfunction, and much worse REM sleep behavior disorder than biotype 2 at baseline. Although disease durations at the initial visit and follow-up were similar between biotypes, patients with PD with smaller subcortical brain volume had poorer prognosis, with more rapid decline in several clinical domains and in dopamine functional neuroimaging over an average of 5 years.ConclusionRobust neuroanatomic biotypes exist in PD with distinct clinical and neuroanatomic patterns. These biotypes can be detected at diagnosis and predict the course of longitudinal progression, which should benefit trial design and evaluation.  © American Academy of Neurology.","","Aged; Cluster Analysis; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease; Positron-Emission Tomography; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; aged; classification; cluster analysis; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; female; human; longitudinal study; male; metabolism; middle aged; Parkinson disease; positron emission tomography; x-ray computed tomography","W.

Methods: One hundred-eighty community-recruited cognitively intact older adults (mean age 68 years, range 52–80 years, 81 women) belonging to the Flemish Prevent Alzheimer’s Disease Cohort KU Leuven (F-PACK) longitudinal observational cohort underwent a baseline evaluation consisting of detailed cognitive assessment, structural MRI and 18F-flutemetamol PET. At inclusion, subjects were stratified based on Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) val66met polymorphism according to a factorial design. At inclusion, 15% were amyloid-PET positive (Centiloid >23.4). All subjects underwent 2-yearly follow-up of cognitive performance for a 4-year time period. Baseline cognitive scores were analysed using factor analysis. The slope of cognitive change over time was modelled using latent growth curve analysis. Using correlation analysis, hierarchical regression and mediation analysis, we examined the effect of demographic (age, sex, education) and genetic variables, baseline cognition, MRI volumetric (both voxelwise and region-based) as well as amyloid imaging measures on the longitudinal slope of cognitive change. Results: A base model of age and sex explained 18.5% of variance in episodic memory decline. This increased to 41.6% by adding baseline episodic memory scores. Adding amyloid load or volumetric measures explained only a negligible additional amount of variance (increase to 42.2%). A mediation analysis indicated that the effect of age on episodic memory scores was partly direct and partly mediated via hippocampal volume. Amyloid load did not play a significant role as mediator between age, hippocampal volume and episodic memory decline. Conclusion: In cognitively intact older adults, the strongest baseline predictor of subsequent episodic memory decline was the baseline episodic memory score. When this score was included, only very limited explanatory power was added by brain volume or amyloid load measures. The data warn against classifications that are purely biomarker-based and highlight the value of baseline cognitive performance levels in predictive models. © 2021, The Author(s).","Ageing; Alzheimer’s disease; Cognitive decline; Mediation; Preclinical","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Positron-Emission Tomography; amyloid protein; apolipoprotein E; brain derived neurotrophic factor; fluorine 18; amyloid beta protein; adult; age; aged; Article; brain size; cognition; cognition assessment; cohort analysis; educational status; episodic memory; female; follow up; gender; genetic variation; hippocampus; human; longitudinal study; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observational study; positron emission tomography; priority journal; risk factor; Alzheimer disease; cognition; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; genetics; middle aged; neuropsychological test; very elderly","R.

As the spinal cord is relaying sensorimotor control signals from the cortex to the peripheral nervous system and vice-versa, it is indeed a very interesting question to assess whether it is affected by atrophy due to a disease that is known for its involvement of cognitive domains first and foremost, with motor symptoms being clinically assessed too. We, therefore, hypothesize that in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), severe atrophy can affect the spinal cord too and that spinal cord atrophy is indeed an important in vivo imaging biomarker contributing to understanding neurodegeneration associated with dementia. Methods: 3DT1 images of 31 AD and 35 healthy control (HC) subjects were processed to calculate volume of brain structures and cross-sectional area (CSA) and volume (CSV) of the cervical cord [per vertebra as well as the C2-C3 pair (CSA23 and CSV23)]. Correlated features (ρ > 0.7) were removed, and the best subset identified for patients’ classification with the Random Forest algorithm. General linear model regression was used to find significant differences between groups (p ≤ 0.05). Linear regression was implemented to assess the explained variance of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score as a dependent variable with the best features as predictors. Results: Spinal cord features were significantly reduced in AD, independently of brain volumes. Patients classification reached 76% accuracy when including CSA23 together with volumes of hippocampi, left amygdala, white and gray matter, with 74% sensitivity and 78% specificity. CSA23 alone explained 13% of MMSE variance. Discussion: Our findings reveal that C2-C3 spinal cord atrophy contributes to discriminate AD from HC, together with more established features. The results show that CSA23, calculated from the same 3DT1 scan as all other brain volumes (including right and left hippocampi), has a considerable weight in classification tasks warranting further investigations. Together with recent studies revealing that AD atrophy is spread beyond the temporal lobes, our result adds the spinal cord to a number of unsuspected regions involved in the disease. Interestingly, spinal cord atrophy explains also cognitive scores, which could significantly impact how we model sensorimotor control in degenerative diseases with a primary cognitive domain involvement. Prospective studies should be purposely designed to understand the mechanisms of atrophy and the role of the spinal cord in AD. © Copyright © 2020 Lorenzi, Palesi, Castellazzi, Vitali, Anzalone, Bernini, Cotta Ramusino, Sinforiani, Micieli, Costa, D’Angelo and Gandini Wheeler-Kingshott.","Alzheimer’s diagnosis; brain atrophy; cross-sectional area (CSA); dementia biomarker; dementia—Alzheimer’s disease; sensorymotor function impairment; spinal cord atrophy; spinal cord toolbox","aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain atrophy; brain size; cervical spinal cord; clinical article; controlled study; dementia; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diffusion weighted imaging; female; gray matter; human; image analysis; in vivo study; machine learning; male; Mini Mental State Examination; nerve degeneration; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; sensorimotor function; spinal cord; spinal cord atrophy; white matter","R.M.

This paper deals with the problem of exploiting both data, in a combined way, to develop a tool able to support clinicians in the study and diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In this work, 69 subjects from the ADNI open database, 33 AD patients and 36 healthy controls, were analyzed. The possible existence of a relationship between brain structure modifications and altered functions between patients and healthy controls was investigated performing a correlation analysis on brain volume, calculated from the MRI image, the clustering coefficient, derived from fRMI acquisitions, and the Mini Mental Score Examination (MMSE). A statistically-significant correlation was found only in four ROIs after Bonferroni's correction. The correlation analysis alone was still not sufficient to provide a reliable and powerful clinical tool in AD diagnosis however. Therefore, a machine learning strategy was studied by training a set of support vector machine classifiers comparing different features. The use of a unimodal approach led to unsatisfactory results, whereas the multimodal approach, i.e., the synergistic combination of MRI, fMRI, and MMSE features, resulted in an accuracy of 95.65%, a specificity of 97.22%, and a sensibility of 93.93%. © 2019 by the authors.","Alzheimer's disease; Biomedical image processing; Biomedical signal processing; Cognitive science; Correlation analysis; Graph theory; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical diagnostic imaging; SVM","","A.

We extract subcortical segmentation and cortical parcellation from corresponding T1-weighted images using FreeSurfer v.6.0, select bilateral 3D regions of interest relevant to neurodegeneration/dementia, and fit their longitudinal volume trajectories using linear mixed effects models. Features describing these model-based trajectories are then used to train an ensemble of machine learning classifiers to distinguish stable CN from converters to MCI, and stable MCI from converters to AD. On separate test sets the models achieved an average of accuracy/precision/recall score of 69/73/60% for converted to MCI and 75/74/77% for converted to AD, illustrating the framework's ability to extract predictive imaging-based biomarkers from routine T1-weighted MRI acquisitions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Alzheimer's disease; Longitudinal data analysis; Machine learning; Mild cognitive impairment; Mixed effects models; MRI","Alzheimer Disease; Australia; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Biomarkers; D region; Image segmentation; Machine learning; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neuroimaging; Trajectories; Alzheimer's disease; Linear mixed-effects model; Mild cognitive impairments (MCI); Mixed effects models; Neurodegeneration; Predictive models; Regions of interest; Subcortical segmentation; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain atrophy; brain size; brain ventricle; conceptual framework; controlled study; dementia; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; disease marker; early diagnosis; feature extraction; feature selection; female; hippocampus; human; leave one out cross validation; longitudinal study; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; nerve degeneration; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; predictive value; priority journal; scoring system; three-dimensional imaging; very elderly; Alzheimer disease; Australia; brain; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; Predictive analytics","S.A.

However, it is yet unknown how this information can be used in the radiological decision-making process. The present study investigates the diagnostic value of NBVRs for detection and differential diagnosis of distinct regional brain atrophy in several dementing neurodegenerative disorders. Methods: NBVRs were obtained for 81 consecutive patients with distinct dementing neurodegenerative diseases and 13 healthy controls (HC). Forty Alzheimer’s disease (AD; 18 with dementia, 22 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 11 posterior cortical atrophy (PCA)), 20 frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and ten semantic dementia (SD) cases were analyzed, and reports were tested qualitatively for the representation of atrophy patterns. Gold standard diagnoses were based on the patients’ clinical course, FDG-PET imaging, and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers following established diagnostic criteria. Diagnostic accuracy of pattern representations was calculated. Results: NBVRs improved the correct identification of patients vs. healthy controls based on structural MRI for rater 1 (p < 0.001) whereas the amount of correct classifications was rather unchanged for rater 2. Correct differential diagnosis of dementing neurodegenerative disorders was significantly improved for both rater 1 (p = 0.001) and rater 2 (p = 0.022). Furthermore, interrater reliability was improved from moderate to excellent for both detection and differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases (κ = 0.556/0.894 and κ = 0.403/0.850, respectively). Conclusion: NBVRs deliver valuable and observer-independent information, which can improve differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Key Points: • Normative brain volume reports increase detection of neurodegenerative atrophy patterns compared to visual reading alone. • Differential diagnosis of regionally distinct atrophy patterns is improved. • Agreement between radiologists is significantly improved from moderate to excellent when using normative brain volume reports. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","Alzheimer disease; Brain; Frontotemporal lobar degeneration; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegenerative disorder","Aged; Algorithms; Brain; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Positron-Emission Tomography; Reproducibility of Results; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain atrophy; brain cortex atrophy; brain size; clinical practice; cohort analysis; controlled study; degenerative disease; dementia; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; differential diagnosis; disease classification; female; frontotemporal dementia; human; interrater reliability; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; predictive value; priority journal; retrospective study; semantic dementia; sensitivity and specificity; algorithm; brain; degenerative disease; differential diagnosis; pathology; positron emission tomography; procedures; reproducibility","D.M.

According to the current biomarker framework for “unbiased descriptive classification”, biomarkers of neurodegeneration, “N”, constitute a critical component in the tri-category “A/T/N” system. Current biomarkers of neurodegeneration suffer from potential drawbacks such as requiring invasive lumbar puncture, involving ionizing radiation, or representing a late, irreversible marker. Recent human studies have suggested that reduced brain oxygen metabolism may be a new functional marker of neurodegeneration in AD, but the heterogeneity and the presence of mixed pathology in human patients did not allow a full understanding of the role of oxygen extraction and metabolism in AD. In this report, global brain oxygen metabolism and related physiological parameters were studied in two AD mouse models with relatively pure pathology, using advanced MRI techniques including T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) and phase contrast (PC) MRI. Additionally, regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was determined with pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling. Reduced global oxygen extraction fraction (by −18.7%, p = 0.008), unit-mass cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) (by −17.4%, p = 0.04) and total CMRO2 (by −30.8%, p < 0.001) were observed in Tau4RΔK mice—referred to as the tau AD model—which manifested pronounced neurodegeneration, as measured by diminished brain volume (by −15.2%, p < 0.001). Global and regional CBF in these mice were not different from those of wild-type mice (p > 0.05), suggesting normal vascular function. By contrast, in B6;SJL-Tg [APPSWE]2576Kha (APP) mice—referred to as the amyloid AD model—no brain volume reduction, as well as relatively intact brain oxygen extraction and metabolism, were found (p > 0.05). Consistent with the imaging data, behavioral measures of walking distance were impaired in Tau4RΔK mice (p = 0.004), but not in APP mice (p = 0.88). Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that noninvasive MRI measurement of brain oxygen metabolism may be a promising biomarker of neurodegeneration in AD. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Alzheimer's disease; arterial spin labeling; cerebral blood flow; cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen; oxygen extraction fraction; phase contrast; TRUST","Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Oxygen; Spin Labels; tau Proteins; Biomarkers; Brain; Extraction; Glycoproteins; Ionizing radiation; Mammals; Metabolism; Neurodegenerative diseases; Oxygen; Pathology; amyloid; oxygen; tau protein; amyloid; amyloid precursor protein; oxygen; spin label; tau protein; Alzheimer's disease; Arterial spin labeling; Behavioral measures; Cerebral blood flow; Cognitive impairment; Critical component; Oxygen extraction fractions; Physiological parameters; Alzheimer disease; animal experiment; animal model; arterial spin labeling; Article; blood oxygenation; brain blood flow; brain metabolism; brain size; cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen; cognition; controlled study; embryo; male; mouse; nerve degeneration; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oxygen extraction fraction; transgene; walking distance; Alzheimer disease; animal; animal behavior; brain; C57BL mouse; diagnostic imaging; disease model; female; metabolism; Physiological models","Z.

Therefore, data sharing in neuroimaging requires special attention to protect participants’ privacy. Facial features removal (FFR) could alleviate these concerns. We assessed the impact of three FFR methods on subsequent automated image analysis to obtain clinically relevant outcome measurements in three clinical groups. Methods: FFR was performed using QuickShear, FaceMasking, and Defacing. In 110 subjects of Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, normalized brain volumes (NBV) were measured by SIENAX. In 70 multiple sclerosis patients of the MAGNIMS Study Group, lesion volumes (WMLV) were measured by lesion prediction algorithm in lesion segmentation toolbox. In 84 glioblastoma patients of the PICTURE Study Group, tumor volumes (GBV) were measured by BraTumIA. Failed analyses on FFR-processed images were recorded. Only cases in which all image analyses completed successfully were analyzed. Differences between outcomes obtained from FFR-processed and full images were assessed, by quantifying the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for absolute agreement and by testing for systematic differences using paired t tests. Results: Automated analysis methods failed in 0–19% of cases in FFR-processed images versus 0–2% of cases in full images. ICC for absolute agreement ranged from 0.312 (GBV after FaceMasking) to 0.998 (WMLV after Defacing). FaceMasking yielded higher NBV (p = 0.003) and WMLV (p ≤ 0.001). GBV was lower after QuickShear and Defacing (both p < 0.001). Conclusions: All three outcome measures were affected differently by FFR, including failure of analysis methods and both “random” variation and systematic differences. Further study is warranted to ensure high-quality neuroimaging research while protecting participants’ privacy. Key Points: • Protecting participants’ privacy when sharing MRI data is important. • Impact of three facial features removal methods on subsequent analysis was assessed in three clinical groups. • Removing facial features degrades performance of image analysis methods. © 2019, The Author(s).","Database; Ethics; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neuroimaging; Privacy","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Confidentiality; Face; Female; Glioblastoma; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Dissemination; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Sclerosis; Neuroimaging; Reproducibility of Results; Tumor Burden; adolescent; adult; algorithm; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain size; controlled study; disease duration; disease severity; Expanded Disability Status Scale; facies; female; glioblastoma; human; image analysis; image registration; lesion volume; major clinical study; male; multiple sclerosis; neuroimaging; outcome assessment; positron emission tomography; priority journal; tumor volume; aged; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; confidentiality; diagnostic imaging; face; information dissemination; middle aged; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; very elderly","A. de Sitter; Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam Neuroscience Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc, Amsterdam, Netherlands; email: A.deSitter@vumc.nl","","Springer","09387994","","EURAE","31691120","English","Eur.

The association of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage with brain volume in this context is not well known. Objective: To test whether neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with decreased brain volume in a cognitively unimpaired population enriched for Alzheimer disease risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study, conducted from January 6, 2010, to January 17, 2019, at an academic research neuroimaging center, used cross-sectional data on 951 participants from 2 large, ongoing cohort studies of Alzheimer disease (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention and Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center clinical cohort). Participants were cognitively unimpaired based on National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association workgroup diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease, confirmed through a consensus diagnosis panel. The cohort was enriched for Alzheimer disease risk based on family history of dementia. Statistical analysis was performed from April 3 to September 27, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The Area Deprivation Index, a geospatially determined index of neighborhood-level disadvantage, and cardiovascular disease risk indices were calculated for each participant. Linear regression models were fitted to test associations between relative neighborhood-level disadvantage (highest 20% based on state of residence) and hippocampal and total brain tissue volume, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Results: In the primary analysis of 951 participants (637 women [67.0%]; mean [SD] age, 63.9 [8.1] years), living in the 20% most disadvantaged neighborhoods was associated with 4.1% lower hippocampal volume (β = -317.44; 95% CI, -543.32 to -91.56; P =.006) and 2.0% lower total brain tissue volume (β = -20959.67; 95% CI, -37611.92 to -4307.43; P =.01), after controlling for intracranial volume, individual-level educational attainment, age, and sex. Robust propensity score-matched analyses determined that this association was not due to racial/ethnic or demographic characteristics. Cardiovascular risk score, examined in a subsample of 893 participants, mediated this association for total brain tissue but not for hippocampal volume. Conclusions and Relevance: For cognitively unimpaired individuals, living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods was associated with significantly lower cerebral volumes, after controlling for maximal premorbid (total intracranial) volume. This finding suggests an association of community socioeconomic context, distinct from individual-level socioeconomic status, with brain volume during aging. Cardiovascular risk mediated this association for total brain tissue volume but not for hippocampal volume, suggesting that neighborhood-level disadvantage may be associated with these 2 outcomes via distinct biological pathways. © 2020 American Medical Association.

Childhood traumatic events are more frequent in SZ and BD than in healthy individuals (HC), and based on recent findings in healthy individuals could represent one important factor for TL and brain aberrations in patients. The study comprised 1024 individuals (SZ [n = 373]; BD [n = 249] and HC [n = 402]). TL was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and childhood trauma was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Diagnosis was obtained by the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) for the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-IV (DSM-IV). FreeSurfer was used to obtain regional and global brain volumes from T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. All analyses were adjusted for current age and sex. Patients had on average shorter TL (F = 7.87, p = 0.005, Cohen’s d = 0.17) and reported more childhood trauma experiences than HC (χ                             2                              = 148.9, p < 0.001). Patients with a history of childhood sexual, physical or emotional abuse had shorter TL relative to HC and to patients without a history of childhood abuse (F = 6.93, p = 0.006, Cohen’s d = 0.16). After adjusting for childhood abuse, no difference in TL was observed between patients and HC (p = 0.12). There was no statistically significant difference in reported childhood abuse exposure or TL between SZ and BD. Our analyses revealed no significant associations between TL and clinical characteristics or brain morphometry. We demonstrate shorter TL in SZ and BD compared with HC and showed that TL is sensitive to childhood trauma experiences. Further studies are needed to identify the biological mechanisms of this relationship.                          © 2019, The Author(s).","","Adult; Bipolar Disorder; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child Abuse; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Norway; Schizophrenia; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telomere; Telomere Shortening; Young Adult; adult; age; aged; amygdala; Article; brain scintiscanning; brain size; brain stem; caudate nucleus; cerebellum; child abuse; child sexual abuse; childhood trauma; Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; controlled study; cortical thickness (brain); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; disease association; emotional abuse; female; globus pallidus; hippocampus; human; major clinical study; male; mental disease; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nucleus accumbens; physical abuse; polymerase chain reaction; putamen; sex difference; structured interview; superior frontal gyrus; surface area; telomere length; thalamus; bipolar disorder; brain; case control study; child; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; genetics; multicenter study; Norway; pathology; psychology; questionnaire; schizophrenia; telomere; telomere shortening; young adult","M.

Recently developed tau PET imaging tracers are candidate biomarkers for diagnosis and staging of AD. Objective: We aimed to investigate the discriminative ability of 18F-THK5317 and 18F-flortaucipir tracers and brain atrophy at different stages of AD, and their respective associations with cognition. Methods: Two cohorts, each including 29 participants (healthy controls [HC], prodromal AD, and AD dementia patients), underwent 18F-THK5317 or 18F-flortaucipir PET, T1-weighted MRI, and neuropsychological assessment. For each subject, we quantified regional 18F-THK5317 and 18F-flortaucipir uptake within six bilateral and two composite regions of interest. We assessed global brain atrophy for each individual by quantifying the brain volume index, a measure of brain volume-to-cerebrospinal fluid ratio. We then quantified the discriminative ability of regional 18F-THK5317, 18F-flortaucipir, and brain volume index between diagnostic groups, and their associations with cognition in patients. Results: Both 18F-THK5317 and 18F-flortaucipir outperformed global brain atrophy in discriminating between HC and both prodromal AD and AD dementia groups. 18F-THK5317 provided the highest discriminative ability between HC and prodromal AD groups. 18F-flortaucipir performed best at discriminating between prodromal and dementia stages of AD. Across all patients, both tau tracers were predictive of RAVL learning, but only 18F-flortaucipir predicted MMSE. Conclusion: Our results warrant further in vivo head-to-head and antemortem-postmortem evaluations. These validation studies are needed to select tracers with high clinical validity as biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis, and disease staging, which will facilitate their incorporation in clinical practice and therapeutic trials.  © 2021 - The authors.

However, little is known about sex differences in the high-risk stages for psychosis. The present study investigated sex differences in cortical and subcortical neuroanatomy in individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis and healthy controls (CTL), and the relationship between anatomy and clinical symptoms in males at CHR. Magnetic resonance images were collected in 26 individuals at CHR (13 men) and 29 CTLs (15 men) to determine total and regional brain volumes and morphology, cortical thickness, and surface area (SA). Clinical symptoms were assessed with the brief psychiatric rating scale. Significant sex-by-diagnosis interactions were observed with opposite directions of effect in male and female CHR subjects relative to their same-sex controls in multiple cortical and subcortical areas. The right postcentral, left superior parietal, inferior parietal supramarginal, and angular gyri [<5% false discovery rate (FDR)] were thicker in male and thinner in female CHR subjects compared with their same-sex CTLs. The same pattern was observed in the right superior parietal gyrus SA at the regional and vertex level. Using a recently developed surface-based morphology pipeline, we observed sex-specific shape differences in the left hippocampus (<5% FDR) and amygdala (<10% FDR). Negative symptom burden was significantly higher in male compared with female CHR subjects (p = 0.04) and was positively associated with areal expansion of the left amygdala in males (<5% FDR). Some limitations of the study include the sample size, and data acquisition at 1.5 T. This study demonstrates neuroanatomical sex differences in CHR subjects, which may be associated with variations in symptomatology in men and women with psychotic symptoms.

The goal of this study was to assess the presence and location of hyperactivation in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who were later diagnosed with dementia, examine how hyperactivation changes longitudinally, and whether it is related to time before dementia. Forty participants, 26 with MCI and 14 CTL were enrolled in the study. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure functional activation while participants encoded word-pairs as well as cortical thickness and regional brain volume at study entry (Y0) and two years later (Y2). Clinical follow-up was completed every two years following study entry to identify progressors (pMCI), that is, individuals who later received a diagnosis of dementia. Task-related activation was assessed in pMCI in both hippocampi and in regions showing greater cortical thinning from Y0 to Y2 compared to CTLs. Hyperactivation was found in pMCI individuals in the right supramarginal gyrus. Persons with pMCI also showed hypoactivation in the left hippocampus and left pars opercularis. Both hyper- and hypoactivation were present at Y0 and Y2 and did not change longitudinally. Activation was not associated with time before dementia diagnosis. Smaller volume and thinner cortical thickness were associated with shorter time to diagnosis in the left hippocampus and left pars opercularis. In conclusion, hyperactivation was found in individuals who later progressed to dementia, confirming that it might represent an early biomarker to identify individuals in the prodromal phase of AD and that its understanding could contribute to elucidate the key brain mechanisms that precede dementia. © 2019 The Authors","Alzheimer's disease; Episodic memory; Longitudinal fMRI; Mild cognitive impairment; Task-related hyperactivation","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cognitive Dysfunction; Dementia; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; aged; angular gyrus; anterior cingulate; Article; brain size; cerebellum; clinical article; clinical assessment; cortical thickness (brain); dementia; female; follow up; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; image processing; inferior frontal gyrus; left hippocampus; male; medial temporal lobe; middle frontal gyrus; mild cognitive impairment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occipital gyrus; parietal lobe; pars opercularis; pars orbitalis; posterior cingulate; precuneus; priority journal; right hippocampus; superior frontal gyrus; supplementary motor area; supramarginal gyrus; Alzheimer disease; brain; brain mapping; cognitive defect; dementia; disease exacerbation; longitudinal study; middle aged; pathophysiology","S.

Design Rapid review of primary research studies. Methods and outcomes PubMed, Embase and Web of Science Core Collection were searched for articles meeting the criteria published on/before 13 February 2020. The review excluded papers not in English, focused on transient states (eg, mental fatigue) or not using individual-level measures of brain health (eg, average school test scores). Brain health measures of interest included cognitive function, clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment/dementia/ADRD and brain biomarkers such as those from MRI, measures typically associated with ADRD risk and disease progression. Results Twenty-two papers were published from 2012 to 2020, 36% on 18 years old, 32% on 18-64 years old and 59% on ≥65 years old. Sixty-four per cent defined green space based on the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index ( € greenness'/healthy vegetation) and 68% focused on cognitive measures of brain health (eg, memory). Seventeen studies (77%) found green space-brain health associations (14 positive, 4 inverse). Greater greenness/green space was positively associated various cognitive domains in 10 studies and with MRI outcomes (regional brain volumes, cortical thickness, amygdala integrity) in three studies. Greater neighbourhood greenness was associated with lower odds/risk of cognitive impairment/ADRD in some studies but increased odds/risk in others (n=4 studies). Conclusions Published studies suggest positive green space-brain health associations across the life course, but the methods and cohorts were limited and heterogeneous. Future research using racially/ethnically and geographically diverse cohorts, life course methods and more specific green space and brain health measures (eg, time spent in green spaces, ADRD biomarkers) will strengthen evidence for causal associations. © ","delirium & cognitive disorders; dementia; old age psychiatry; preventive medicine; public health","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Humans; Middle Aged; Parks, Recreational; Young Adult; biological marker; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; amygdala; Article; brain analysis; brain size; child; cognitive defect; cortical thickness (brain); dementia; dysthymia; groups by age; human; memory; neighborhood; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; recreational park; vegetation; adolescent; brain; cognition; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; recreational park; young adult","L.

A list of blood biomarkers has been reported but none has been validated for the Alzheimer's clinic. The changes in hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid peptide in the cerebrospinal fluid is currently used as a tool in the clinics and for research purposes, but this method is highly invasive. Recently, we reported a non-invasive and reliable blood biomarker that correlates the increase in the ratio of heavy tau (HMWtau) and the low molecular weight tau (LMWtau) in human platelets and the decrease in the brain volume as measured by structural MRI. This molecular marker has been named Alz-tau®. Beyond the clinical trials developed with a Latin American population, the present study focuses on an evaluation of this biomarker in a Caucasian population. We examined 36 AD patients and 15 cognitively normal subjects recruited in Barcelona, Spain. Tau levels in platelets were determined by immunoreactivity and the cognitive status by using GDS and MMSE neuropsychological tests. The HMW/LMW tau ratio was statistically different between controls and AD patients. A high correlation was found between the increase in MMSE scores and HMW/LMW tau ratio. This study showed that this ratio is significantly higher in AD patients than controls. Moreover, this study on a peripheral marker of AD is valuable to understanding the AD pathogenesis. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

The brain damage can be detected using brain volume and whole brain form. The complete cure has not been discovered yet and the detection of AD in an early stage helps to slow down the disease. Its progression develops in various stages as MCI, Dementia and AD. A CAD tool for diagnosing AD using structural Magnetic Resonance Image (MRIs) has been proposed. It uses information from Gray Matter (GM) and White Matter (WM) tissue distribution in the brain. Images have been resized and Median filter has been used for removing noise from images and as a preprocessing step. Morphological operations has been done and shown as a binary image and ROI analysis were performed on both white and grey matter tissues. It can be analyzed by the image resulting from the registered image. © BEIESP.","Alzheimer’s disease; Classification; Feature extraction; MRI; Segmentation; Support vector machine","","","","Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication","22783075","","","","English","Int.

Individually, however, these modalities tend to lack precision in both AD diagnosis and AD staging. A joint MRI–EEG approach that combines structural with functional information has the potential to overcome these limitations. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study systematically investigated the link between MRI and EEG markers and the global cognitive status in early AD. We hypothesized that the joint modalities would identify cognitive deficits with higher accuracy than the individual modalities. In a cohort of 111 AD patients, we combined MRI measures of cortical thickness and regional brain volume with EEG measures of rhythmic activity, information processing and functional coupling in a generalized multiple regression model. Machine learning classification was used to evaluate the markers’ utility in accurately separating the subjects according to their cognitive score. Results: We found that joint measures of temporal volume, cortical thickness, and EEG slowing were well associated with the cognitive status and explained 38.2% of ifs variation. The inclusion of the covariates age, sex, and education considerably improved the model. The joint markers separated the subjects with an accuracy of 84.7%, which was considerably higher than by using individual modalities. Conclusions: These results suggest that including joint MRI–EEG markers may be beneficial in the diagnostic workup, thus allowing for adequate treatment. Further studies in larger populations, with a longitudinal design and validated against functional-metabolic imaging are warranted to confirm the results. © 2018 The Authors.

The system permits the evaluation of the volumes of grey matter in subjects such as the AD or the conditions related to it and are compared in an automated manner with the healthy controls in the entire brain. The article also reviews the findings of the VBM that are related to various stages of the AD and also its prodrome known as the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). For this work, the Ada Boost classifier has been proposed to be a good selector of feature that brings down the classification error’s upper bound. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) had been employed for the dimensionality reduction and for improving efficiency. The PCA is a powerful, as well as a reliable, tool in data analysis. Calculating fitness scores will be an independent process. For this reason, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) along with a greedy search may be computed easily along with some high-performance systems of computing. The primary goal of this work was to identify better collections or permutations of the classifiers that are weak to build stronger ones. The results of the experiment prove that the GAs is one more alternative technique used for boosting the permutation of weak classifiers identified in Ada Boost which can produce some better solutions compared to the classical Ada Boost. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Alzheimer’s Disease (AD); Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Greedy Search; Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); Principal Component Analysis (PCA); Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM)","Algorithms; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Gray Matter; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Principal Component Analysis; Severity of Illness Index; algorithm; Alzheimer disease; Article; computer assisted radiography; diagnostic accuracy; feature extraction; genetic algorithm; human; mild cognitive impairment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; principal component analysis; support vector machine; voxel based morphometry; Alzheimer disease; brain; cognitive defect; computer assisted diagnosis; gray matter; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; principal component analysis; procedures; severity of illness index","S.

This limits the usefulness of the diagnosis as a basis for both research and clinical management. Methods of reducing this heterogeneity may inform the diagnostic classification. With this in mind, we performed k-means clustering with symptom and cognitive measures to generate groups in a machine-driven way. We found that our data was best organised in three clusters: high cognitive performance, high positive symptomatology, low positive symptomatology. We hypothesized that these clusters represented biological categories, which we tested by comparing these groups in terms of brain volumetric information. We included all the groups in an ANCOVA analysis with post hoc tests, where brain volume areas were modelled as dependent variables, controlling for age and estimated intracranial volume. We found six brain volumes significantly differed between the clusters: left caudate, left cuneus, left lateral occipital, left inferior temporal, right lateral, and right pars opercularis. The k-means clustering provides a way of subtyping schizophrenia which appears to have a biological basis, though one that requires both replication and confirmation of its clinical significance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Clustering; Data-driven subgrouping; Positive and negative symptoms; Schizophrenia","Brain; Cluster Analysis; Cognition; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Schizophrenia; adult; analysis of covariance; Article; brain size; caudate nucleus; cognition; comparative study; cuneus; dependent variable; disease classification; female; human; major clinical study; male; pars opercularis; post hoc analysis; priority journal; schizophrenia; symptom assessment; symptomatology; brain; classification; cluster analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; schizophrenia","L.F.

Objective: We evaluated the prognostic utility of identifying longitudinal neuropsychological decline along with single cognitive exam and Alzheimer's disease (AD) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in predicting dementia.We also examined brain volumetric differences based on decline trajectories. Method: Regression models quantified 12-month neuropsychological decline relative to normative expectations among nondemented older adults (N= 1,074). Progression to dementia over follow-up (18-120 months)was diagnosed using independent modes of assessment. Results: In Cox regression models controlling for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E4, and baseline cognitive diagnosis, neuropsychological decline predicted increased dementia risk, χ2 = 69.861, p < 0.001, odds ratio = 2.841, even after correction for CSF biomarkers (amyloid-β, phosphorylated tau, total tau), χ2 = 26.365, p < 0.001, odds ratio = 2.283. Voxel-based morphometry analysis indicated smaller hippocampal and medial temporal volume in participants with neuropsychological decline. Conclusions: Longitudinal diagnosis of neuropsychological decline improved prognostic accuracy beyond single cognitive exam diagnoses and AD CSF biomarkers, even in asymptomatic older adults. Older adults with a trajectory of neuropsychological decline exhibit smaller medial temporal and hippocampal brain volume. Longitudinal diagnostic approaches may benefit selection and randomization procedures for AD clinical trials in asymptomatic individuals. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

Brain atrophy in this disease spectrum begins in the medial temporal lobe structure, which can be recognized by magnetic resonance imaging. To overcome the unsatisfactory inter-observer reliability of visual evaluation, quantitative brain volumetry has been developed and widely investigated for the diagnosis of MCI and AD. The aim of this study was to assess the prediction accuracy of quantitative brain volumetry using a fully automated segmentation software package, NeuroQuant®, for the diagnosis of MCI. Materials and Methods: A total of 418 subjects from the Korean Brain Aging Study for Early Diagnosis and Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease cohort were included in our study. Each participant was allocated to either a cognitively normal old group (n = 285) or an MCI group (n = 133). Brain volumetric data were obtained from T1-weighted images using the NeuroQuant software package. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to investigate relevant brain regions and their prediction accuracies. Results: Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that normative percentiles of the hippocampus (P < 0.001), amygdala (P = 0.003), frontal lobe (P = 0.049), medial parietal lobe (P = 0.023), and third ventricle (P = 0.012) were independent predictive factors for MCI. In ROC analysis, normative percentiles of the hippocampus and amygdala showed fair accuracies in the diagnosis of MCI (area under the curve: 0.739 and 0.727, respectively). Conclusion: Normative percentiles of the hippocampus and amygdala provided by the fully automated segmentation software could be used for screening MCI with a reasonable post-processing time.

Recently, researchers have developed a new method for the instinctive analysis of AD based on machine learning and its subfield, deep learning. Recent state-of-the-art techniques consider multimodal diagnosis, which has been shown to achieve high accuracy compared to a unimodal prognosis. Furthermore, many studies have used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure brain volumes and the volume of subregions, as well as to search for diffuse changes in white/gray matter in the brain. In this study, T1-weighted structural MRI was used for the early classification of AD. MRI results in high-intensity visible features, making preprocessing and segmentation easy. To use this image modality, we acquired four types of datasets from each dataset's server. In this work, we downloaded 326 subjects from the National Research Center for Dementia homepage, 123 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) homepage, 121 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Repository Without Borders homepage, and 131 subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center homepage. In our experiment, we used the multiatlas label propagation with expectation-maximization-based refinement segmentation method. We segmented the images into 138 anatomical morphometry images (in which 40 features belonged to subcortical volumes and the remaining 98 features belonged to cortical thickness). The entire dataset was split into a 70: 30 (training and testing) ratio before classifying the data. A principal component analysis was used for dimensionality reduction. Then, the support vector machine radial basis function classifier was used for classification between two groups - AD versus health control (HC) and early mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (EMCI) versus late MCI (LMCI). The proposed method performed very well for all four types of dataset. For instance, for the AD versus HC group, the classifier achieved an area under curve (AUC) of more than 89% for each dataset. For the EMCI versus LMCI group, the classifier achieved an AUC of more than 80% for every dataset. Moreover, we also calculated Cohen kappa and Jaccard index statistical values for all datasets to evaluate the classification reliability. Finally, we compared our results with those of recently published state-of-the-art methods.  © 2020 Saidjalol Toshkhujaev et al.","","Aged; Algorithms; Alzheimer Disease; Area Under Curve; Cognition Disorders; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Support Vector Machine; United States; Brain; Brain mapping; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Diagnosis; Dimensionality reduction; Image classification; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Maximum principle; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; apolipoprotein E; Expectation - maximizations; Mild cognitive impairments; Mild cognitive impairments (MCI); Multimodal diagnosis; Radial basis function classifiers; Segmentation methods; State-of-the-art methods; Training and testing; academic achievement; adolescent; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; binary classification; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical article; clinical feature; comparative study; convolutional neural network; cortical thickness (brain); deep learning; feature selection; female; gray matter; human; infant; interrater reliability; male; Markov random field; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prediction; prognosis; random forest; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; white matter; algorithm; Alzheimer disease; area under the curve; automated pattern recognition; classification; cognitive defect; factual database; image processing; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; principal component analysis; procedures; reproducibility; United States; Neurodegenerative diseases","G.-R.

Diagnosis of this disorder in the early phases of the disease is a vital task to rescue patients’ lives from bad consequences and provide them with better healthcare. Machine learning methods have been proven to be accurate in predicting dementia in the early phases of the disease. The prediction of dementia depends heavily on the type of collected data which usually are gathered from Normalized Whole Brain Volume (nWBV) and Atlas Scaling Factor (ASF) which are normally measured and corrected from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs). Other biological features such as age and gender can also help in the diagnosis of dementia. Although many studies use machine learning for predicting dementia, we could not reach a conclusion on the stability of these methods for which one is more accurate under different experimental conditions. Therefore, this paper investigates the conclusion stability regarding the performance of machine learning algorithms for dementia prediction. To accomplish this, a large number of experiments were run using 7 machine learning algorithms and two feature reduction algorithms namely, Information Gain (IG) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To examine the stability of these algorithms, thresholds of feature selection were changed for the IG from 20% to 100% and the PCA dimension from 2 to 8. This has resulted in 7×9 + 7×7= 112 experiments. In each experiment, various classification evaluation data were recorded. The obtained results show that among seven algorithms the support vector machine and Naïve Bayes are the most stable algorithms while changing the selection threshold. Also, it was found that using IG would seem more efficient than using PCA for predicting Dementia. These promising results open the door to a new era of early prognosis of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). © 2022 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Dementia disorder; Feature reduction; Feature selection; Machine learning; Stability analysis","","M.

A pathological effect of Alzheimer's disease is brain atrophy, which is the progressive shrinkage of the brain volume and weight. Another effect of Alzheimer's disease is the enlargement of lateral ventricles in the brain. Currently, MRI and CT scanners can detect and show images of the brain during different stages of Alzheimer's disease. However, its limited accessibility, high costs, and static structure make it inconvenient for some to use. This paper presents the design and novel application of a wearable device comprising of flexible microwave antennas, with an operating frequency range of 800 MHz-2.5 GHz that detects the progression of brain atrophy and lateral ventricle enlargement in patients with Alzheimer's at the earliest stage possible. The operating principle of the antennas are simulated in near field using CST and the device is experimentally validated using lamb brain samples and samples representing cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). The measured reflection coefficients (S11) and transmission coefficients (S21) were found to correlate with changes in brain volume and changes in CSF volume successfully, thus giving an indication of the progression of Alzheimer's disease in a patient. © 2016 IEEE.","Electromagnetic; microwave medical imaging; non-invasive monitoring; RF medical diagnosis; RF sensing","Brain; Cerebrospinal fluid; Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Microwave antennas; Wearable antennas; Alzheimer's disease; Cerebral spinal fluids; Electromagnetic; Non-invasive monitoring; Operating principles; Pathological effects; RF sensing; Transmission coefficients; Neurodegenerative diseases","I.M.

A key ingredient to achieving this goal is the reliable identification of individuals at risk well before they develop clinical symptoms. The aim of this study was to provide further neuroimaging evidence of the effectiveness of a validated tool, the ANU Alzheimer’s Disease Risk Index, for the assessment of future risk of cognitive decline. Participants were 461 (60–64 years, 48% female) community-living individuals free of dementia at baseline. Associations between risk estimates obtained with the ANU-ADRI, total and regional brain volumes including in the default mode network (DMN) measured at the same assessment and diagnosis of MCI/dementia over a 12-year follow-up were tested in a large sample of community-living individuals free of dementia at baseline. Higher risk estimates on the ANU-ADRI were associated with lower cortical gray matter and particularly in the DMN. Importantly, difference in participants with high and low risk scores explained 7–9% of the observed difference in gray matter volume. In this sample, every one additional risk point on the ANU-ADRI was associated with an 8% increased risk of developing MCI/dementia over a 12-year follow-up and this association was partly mediated by a sub-region of the DMN. Risk of cognitive decline assessed with a validated instrument is associated with gray matter volume, particularly in the DMN, a region known to be implicated in the pathological process of the disease. © 2017, The Author(s).","ANU-ADRI; Dementia risk; DMN; MCI; MRI","Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; apolipoprotein E4; adult; aging; alcohol consumption; Alzheimer disease; Alzheimer Disease Risk Index; Article; body mass; brain scintiscanning; brain size; clinical effectiveness; cognition; cognitive defect; community living; default mode network; dementia; depression; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; genotype; gray matter; groups by age; human; image analysis; left hemisphere; major clinical study; male; mental disease assessment; middle aged; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; risk; smoking; traumatic brain injury; Alzheimer disease; brain; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; procedures; risk assessment; risk factor; validation study","N.

Advances in quantitative neuroimaging have permitted the development of automated segmentation protocols (e.g., FreeSurfer) with significantly increased efficiency compared to earlier manual techniques. While these protocols have been found to be suitable for large-scale, multi-site research studies, we were interested in assessing the practical utility and reliability of automated FreeSurfer protocols compared to manual volumetry on routinely acquired clinical scans. Independent validation studies with newer automated segmentation protocols are scarce. Two FreeSurfer protocols for each of two regions of interest - the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex - were compared against manual volumetry. High reliability and agreement was found between FreeSurfer and manual hippocampal protocols, however, there was lower reliability and agreement between FreeSurfer and manual entorhinal protocols. Although based on a the relatively small sample of subjects drawn from a memory clinic (n = 27), our study findings suggest further refinements to improve measurement error and most accurately depict true regional brain volumes using automated segmentation protocols are required, especially for non-hippocampal mesial temporal structures, to achieve maximal utility for routine clinical evaluations. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

It is characterized by brain atrophy, both on imaging and autopsy, although brain atrophy also occurs during normal aging. In this study, we aim to study brain atrophy during a 2-year interval in AD patients, minimal cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal control (NC). Methods: Data were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). This study included three groups of patients; AD, MCI, and NC. We included participants from ADNI 1, Go, and 2, where patients should have full data regarding demographics, mini-mental state exam (MMSE), and whole brain volume measurements for baseline, 1 year, and 2 years. Results: A total of 336 patients took part in this study, 184 (54.8%) of whom were men. In the studied group, 65 (19.3%), 150 (44.6%), and 121 (36%) were AD, MCI and NC, respectively. The mean change in brain volume for a 1-year interval was 1.52% (±2.15), and for a 2-year interval was 2.22% (±2.12). Only age significantly predicted the 2-year interval change in brain volume (p= 0.009), where one-year increase in age predicted a two-year interval brain volume loss by 0.06% (CI 0.02% to 0.10%). Conclusion: Among the studied factors (age, gender and diagnosis), age was the only factor that significantly predicted the rate of whole brain volume loss with direct correlation between age and rate of volume loss at 2 years of observation. © 2018 University of Jordan.

The objective of this study was to develop, analyze and validate new priors for Bayesian inference of such biomarkers. Theoretical analysis revealed a relationship between the estimates inferred from the model and the true values of measured quantities, and the impact of the priors. This led to a new prior encoding scheme that incorporates objectively measurable domain knowledge, i.e. by performing two measurements with a reference method, which imply scale of the prior distribution. Second, priors on parameters of systematic error are non-informative, which enables biomarker estimation from a set of different quantities. Analysis showed that the volume of nucleus basalis of Meynert, which is reduced in early stages of Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's disease, is inter-related and could be inferred from compartmental brain volume measurements performed on routine clinical MR scans. Another experiment showed that total lesion load, associated to future disability progression in multiple sclerosis patients, could be inferred from lesion volume measurements based on multiple automated MR scan segmentations. Besides, figures of merit derived from the estimates could, without comparing against reference gold standard segmentations, identify the best performing lesion segmentation method. The proposed new priors substantially simplify the application of Bayesian inference for latent biomarkers and thus open an avenue for clinical implementation of new biomarkers, which may ultimately advance the evidence-based medicine. © 2013 IEEE.","Bayesian inference; brain segmentation; latent variable prediction; magnetic resonance imaging; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Quantitative imaging biomarkers; validation","Alzheimer Disease; Bayes Theorem; Biomarkers; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Parkinson Disease; Bayesian networks; Diagnosis; Inference engines; Magnetic resonance imaging; Markov chains; Neurodegenerative diseases; Titration; Volume measurement; biological marker; biological marker; Bayesian inference; Brain segmentation; Latent variable; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; Quantitative imaging; validation; algorithm; Article; Bayesian learning; brain size; computer model; conceptual framework; data analysis; gold standard; human; image analysis; image segmentation; knowledge; Markov chain; mild cognitive impairment; multiple sclerosis; performance; systematic error; Alzheimer disease; Bayes theorem; diagnostic imaging; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; Biomarkers","Z.

It provides interpretable features and its output is a fixed length vector irrespective of the number of input points or their sample times. In this paper we use the path signature to provide features for identifying people whose diagnosis subsequently converts to Alzheimer’s disease. In two separate classification tasks we distinguish converters from 1) healthy individuals, and 2) individuals with mild cognitive impairment. The data used are time-ordered measurements of the whole brain, ventricles and hippocampus from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We find two nonlinear interactions which are predictive in both cases. The first interaction is change of hippocampal volume with time, and the second is a change of hippocampal volume relative to the volume of the whole brain. While hippocampal and brain volume changes are well known in Alzheimer’s disease, we demonstrate the power of the path signature in their identification and analysis without manual feature selection. Sequential data is becoming increasingly available as monitoring technology is applied, and the path signature method is shown to be a useful tool in the processing of this data. © 2019 Moore et al.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether volumetric information obtained from the free and easyto-use online tool volBrain can improve correct identification of MCI patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to visual reading. Methods: The study cohort consisted of 27 patients with MCI due to AD (AD positive) as determined by biomarker information and 26 cognitively normal controls (CN). Three blinded readers, 2 radiologists and 1 clinical dementia expert, assessed the patients' MRI regarding brain atrophy and probability of underlying AD two times, without and with supporting volumetric information from volBrain. To assess diagnostic accuracy of volBrain measures alone, a simple sum score based on basic volumetric measures was developed and tested. Results: Correct patient classification by readers 1, 2, and 3 without a volumetric report was 73.6%, 77.4%, and 83.0%. With a volumetric report, correct classification increased for the radiological readers to 77.4% and 81.1%, respectively and decreased to 77.4% for reader 3. Usage of the volumetric report alone yielded the highest diagnostic accuracy of 84.9%. Diagnostic confidence increased significantly for radiological readers. Conclusion: Volumetric information from volBrain increases the radiologist's diagnostic performance and confidence in identifying MCI patients with AD. We propose that such tools may be implemented in the routine diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected AD. © 2018-IOS Press and the authors.

This multi-structural atrophic information, when integrated as a single differential index, has the potential to further elevate the accuracy of AD identification from normal control (NC) compared to the conventional structure volumetric index. Objective: We herein investigated the performance of such an MRI-derived AD index, AD-Resemblance Atrophy Index (AD-RAI), as a neuroimaging biomarker in clinical scenario. Method: Fifty AD patients (19 with the Amyloid, Tau, Neurodegeneration (ATN) results assessed in cerebrospinal fluid) and 50 age- and gender-matched NC (19 with ATN results assessed using positron emission tomography) were recruited in this study. MRI-based imaging biomarkers, i.e., AD-RAI, were quantified using AccuBrain®. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) of these MRI-based imaging biomarkers were evaluated with the diagnosis result according to clinical criteria for all subjects and ATN biological markers for the subgroup. Results: In the whole groups of AD and NC subjects, the accuracy of AD-RAI was 91%, sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 96%, respectively, and the AUC was 92%. In the subgroup of 19 AD and 19 NC with ATN results, AD-RAI results matched completely with ATN classification. AD-RAI outperforms the volume of any single brain structure measured. Conclusion: The finding supports the hypothesis that MRI-derived composite AD-RAI is a more accurate imaging biomarker than individual brain structure volumetry in the identification of AD from NC in the clinical scenario. © 2021 - IOS Press.

We aimed to determine whether combining automated brain volumetry on MRI and quantitative measurement of tau deposition on [18F] THK-5351 PET can aid discrimination of AD spectrum. From a prospective database in an IRB-approved multicenter study (NCT02656498), 113 subjects (32 healthy control, 55 mild cognitive impairment, and 26 Alzheimer disease) with baseline structural MRI and [18F] THK-5351 PET were included. Cortical volumes were quantified from FDA-approved software for automated volumetric MRI analysis (NeuroQuant). Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was calculated from tau PET images for 6 composite FreeSurfer-derived regions-of-interests approximating in vivo Braak stage (Braak ROIs). On volumetric MRI analysis, stepwise logistic regression analyses identified the cingulate isthmus and inferior parietal lobule as significant regions in discriminating AD from HC and MCI. The combined model incorporating automated volumes of selected brain regions on MRI (cingulate isthmus, inferior parietal lobule, hippocampus) and SUVRs of Braak ROIs on [18F] THK-5351 PET showed higher performance than SUVRs of Braak ROIs on [18F] THK-5351 PET in discriminating AD from HC (0.98 vs 0.88, P = 0.033) but not in discriminating AD from MCI (0.85 vs 0.79, P = 0.178). The combined model showed comparable performance to automated volumes of selected brain regions on MRI in discriminating AD from HC (0.98 vs 0.94, P = 0.094) and MCI (0.85 vs 0.78; P = 0.065). © 2021, The Author(s).","","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Aminopyridines; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Imaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Prospective Studies; Quinolines; Radiopharmaceuticals; tau Proteins; aminopyridine derivative; quinoline derivative; radiopharmaceutical agent; tau protein; THK5351; aged; Alzheimer disease; brain; clinical trial; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; female; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; molecular imaging; multicenter study; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; phase 2 clinical trial; positron emission tomography; procedures; prospective study","S.J.

Thirty-eight MCI patients, eighteen healthy older adults and twenty-three AD patients were included in this study. All participants underwent a brain-MR protocol (1.5 T GE scanner) including high-resolution T1-weighted volumetric sequence (isotropic 1mm                             3                             ). Voxel-wise differences in brain volumetry were evaluated using FreeSurfer software and all volumes were normalized by the total intracranial volume (TIV).

MCI patients underwent a complete neuropsychological assessment at baseline and were clinically re-evaluated after a mean of 28 months; twenty-six MCI patients (68.4%) converted to AD and twelve remained stable. At baseline these two MCI subgroups did not differ in the global cognitive level (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE) or in any of the other cognitive domains; the NAA/ mI ratio in the PCC was able to differentiate MCI converters from those MCI that did not develop AD (p = 0.022) with a level of accuracy (AUC area) of 0.779. A significantly reduced volume of parahippocampal gyrus (p = 0.010) and fusiform gyrus (p = 0.026) were found in the converter MCI subgroup compared to the stable MCI subgroup. The combined use of both N- acetyl-aspartate (NAA)/myo-Inositol (mI) ratio and volume of parahippocampal gyrus, increases the overall accuracy (AUC = 0.910) in predicting the conversion to AD two years before the development of clinical symptoms. Additional longitudinal studies with a broader representative sample of MCI patients and longer follow-up might be helpful to confirm these results and to elucidate the role of each parameter in predicting the possible progression to AD, and also to all the other non-AD dementia subtypes.                          © 2019 The Authors","                                                          <sup>1</sup>                             H-MRS                         ; Alzheimer's disease; Mild cognitive impairment; MRI","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Progression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Predictive Value of Tests; Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Retrospective Studies; inositol; n acetylaspartic acid; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain size; clinical classification; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; disease exacerbation; female; follow up; fusiform gyrus; human; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; neuroimaging; neutron activation analysis; parahippocampal gyrus; posterior cingulate; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; retrospective study; volumetry; Alzheimer disease; brain; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; metabolism; middle aged; neuropsychological test; predictive value; procedures; psychology; very elderly","C.

The eye is part of the central nervous system, and its neurons may be susceptible to degeneration; therefore, changes in the RNFL thickness may reflect microstructural and volume alterations in the brain. Objective: To explore the association between the peripapillary RNFL thickness and brain alterations in the visual and limbic networks in elderly people without dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional analysis of the Three-City/Antioxydants, Lipides Essentiels, Nutrition et Maladies Oculaires (Alienor) Study cohort (April 2009 to December 2010). The dates of analysis were July 2017 to August 2018. The setting was a population-based study in France. The brain volume analysis included 104 participants, and the diffusion tensor imaging analysis included 79 participants. Main Outcomes and Measures: Global RNFL was assessed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Brain volumes were assessed via T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging by measurement of the global white and gray matter fractions and the hippocampal fraction. Brain microstructural alterations were assessed with diffusion tensor imaging at the level of the posterior thalamic radiations, the limbic system tracts (the fornix and cingulum bundles), and the posterior limb of the internal capsule (control region). Linear regression models adjusted for several confounders were performed. Results: Among a total of 104 participants, the mean (SD) age was 80.8 (3.9) years, and the cohort was 56.7% women (n = 59). The mean (SD) global RNFL thickness was 89.3 (12.9) µm. A thicker RNFL was associated with a greater hippocampal fraction (quantity of increase ß = 0.013; 95% CI, 0.001-0.025 per 10-µm increase in the RNFL thickness) and better diffusion tensor imaging variables in the global cingulum (mean diffusivity ß = -0.007; 95% CI, -0.015 to -0.000) and the hippocampal part of the cingulum (mean diffusivity ß = -0.009; 95% CI, -0.016 to -0.002 and radial diffusivity ß = -0.010; 95% CI, -0.018 to -0.002) and the posterior thalamic radiations (fractional anisotropy ß = 0.008; 95% CI, 0.000-0.017). No significant associations were found with other magnetic resonance imaging volumes or with other diffusion tensor imaging variables. In particular, there was no significant association with the control region of interest. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study suggest that in elderly individuals without dementia, a thicker RNFL was associated with better magnetic resonance imaging variables both in a region that included the visual pathways and in regions particularly involved in the neurodegenerative processes of Alzheimer disease.. © 2018 American Medical Association.

In this work, brain tissue volume reduction is estimated to detect Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using magnetic resonance images. The proposed method initially applies Hue Saturation Value-Based Histogram Thresholding Technique to segment the brain tissue. After that, brain volume is estimated using the pixel counting-based method (PCBM) to detect AD. The proposed method was investigated with images obtained from T1-weighted images of cognitive normal (CN) /normal (N) and AD images from Minimum Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and T1- and T2-weighted real-time images collected from a medical diagnostic clinical imaging center. The estimated brain tissue volume between the AD and CN/N brain tissue clearly quantifies the brain tissue reduction and it is compared with existing automatic estimation method statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Comparing to SPM, our PCBM method accurately estimates the brain tissue volumes and can be used as a potential tool to detect AD using MR imaging data. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Alzheimer’s disease; Brain tissue; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pixel counting-based method; Statistical parametric mapping; Volume estimation","Brain; Brain mapping; Cerebrospinal fluid; Diagnosis; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Automatic estimation; Brain image analysis; Histogram thresholding techniques; Hue saturation values; Medical diagnostics; Psychiatric disorders; Statistical parametric mapping; Volume estimations; Tissue","P.

Methods Forty-eight patients fulfilling the criteria of amnestic MCI who underwent a conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by MRS, and T1-3D on 1.5 Tesla MR unit. At baseline the patients underwent neuropsychological examination. 1H-MRS of the brain was carried out by exploring the left medial occipital lobe and ventral posterior cingulated cortex (vPCC) using the LCModel software. A high resolution T1-3D sequence was acquired to carry out the volumetric measurement. A cortical and subcortical parcellation strategy was used to obtain the volumes of each area within the brain. The patients were followed up to detect conversion to probable AD. Results After a 3-year follow-up, 15 (31.2%) patients converted to AD. The myo-inositol in the occipital cortex and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) in the posterior cingulate cortex predicted conversion to probable AD at 46.1% sensitivity and 90.6% specificity. The positive predictive value was 66.7%, and the negative predictive value was 80.6%, with an overall cross-validated classification accuracy of 77.8%. The volume of the third ventricle, the total white matter and entorhinal cortex predict conversion to probable AD at 46.7% sensitivity and 90.9% specificity. The positive predictive value was 70%, and the negative predictive value was 78.9%, with an overall cross-validated classification accuracy of 77.1%. Combining volumetric measures in addition to the MRS measures the prediction to probable AD has a 38.5% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity, with a positive predictive value of 55.6%, a negative predictive value of 77.8% and an overall accuracy of 73.3%. Conclusion Either MRS or brain volumetric measures are markers separately of cognitive decline and may serve as a noninvasive tool to monitor cognitive changes and progression to dementia in patients with amnestic MCI, but the results do not support the routine use in the clinical settings. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Alzheimer's disease; Brain volumetry; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Mild cognitive impairment","Aged; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Organ Size; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; 4 aminobutyric acid; choline; creatine; glutamic acid; glutamine; inositol; n acetylaspartic acid; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain size; brain third ventricle; brain volumetry; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; entorhinal cortex; female; human; left hemisphere; male; mild cognitive impairment; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; occipital cortex; posterior cingulate; predictive value; priority journal; prospective study; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; volumetry; white matter; brain; brain mapping; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; follow up; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; organ size; pathology; procedures; reproducibility","P.J.

Water content varies greatly between individuals, and it changes dramatically over time from birth through senescence of the human life span. We hypothesize that the effects that individual- and age-related variations in water content have on contrast of the brain in MR images also have important, systematic effects on in vivo, MRI-based measures of regional brain volumes. We also hypothesize that changes in water content and tissue contrast across time may account for age-related changes in regional volumes, and that differences in water content or tissue contrast across differing neuropsychiatric diagnoses may account for differences in regional volumes across diagnostic groups.We demonstrate in several complementary ways that subtle variations in water content across age and tissue compartments alter tissue contrast, and that changing tissue contrast in turn alters measures of the thickness and volume of the cortical mantle: (1) We derive analytic relations describing how age-related changes in tissue relaxation times produce age-related changes in tissue gray-scale intensity values and tissue contrast; (2) We vary tissue contrast in computer-generated images to assess its effects on tissue segmentation and volumes of gray matter and white matter; and (3) We use real-world imaging data from adults with either Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder and age- and sex-matched healthy adults to assess the ways in which variations in tissue contrast across diagnoses affects group differences in tissue segmentation and associated volumes.We conclude that in vivo MRI-based morphological measures of the brain, including regional volumes and measures of cortical thickness, are a product of, or at least are confounded by, differences in tissue contrast across individuals, ages, and diagnostic groups, and that differences in tissue contrast in turn likely derive from corresponding differences in water content of the brain across individuals, ages, and diagnostic groups. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Anatomical MRI; Expectation maximization; Markov random field; Segmentation; Tissue contrast","Adult; Artifacts; Body Water; Brain; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Disorders; Organ Size; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Anatomical MRI; Expectation maximization; Markov random field; Segmentation; Tissue contrast; adult; age; algorithm; article; bipolar disorder; brain cortex; brain size; cerebellum; computer analysis; contrast enhancement; controlled study; gray matter; histogram; human; image analysis; image processing; image reconstruction; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parietal cortex; perfusion weighted imaging; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; relaxation time; schizophrenia; water content; white matter","R.

However, relatively little is known about the effects of PA on cognitive function or brain function in those at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease through the presence of the apolipoproteinE epsilon4 (APOE-ε4) allele, diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or the presence of metabolic disease. Here, we examine the question of whether PA and exercise interventions may differentially impact cognitive trajectory, clinical outcomes, and brain structure and function among individuals at the greatest risk for AD. The literature suggests that the protective effects of PA on risk for future dementia appear to be larger in those at increased genetic risk for AD. Exercise training is also effective at helping to promote stable cognitive function in MCI patients, and greater cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with greater brain volume in early-stage AD patients. In APOE-ε4 allele carriers compared to non-carriers, greater levels of PA may be more effective in reducing amyloid burden and are associated with greater activation of semantic memory-related neural circuits. A greater research emphasis should be placed on randomized clinical trials for exercise, with clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging outcomes in people at increased risk for AD. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Alzheimer's disease; APOE genotype; Cognition; Exercise; Genetic risk; Memory; Mild cognitive impairment; MRI; Neuroimaging; Physical activity","apolipoprotein E; allele; Alzheimer disease; brain function; brain size; cognition; connectome; disease carrier; exercise; follow up; genetic risk; genotype; human; incidence; metabolic disorder; mild cognitive impairment; mini mental state examination; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physical activity; positron emission tomography; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; semantic memory","J.

However, in current thinking, the diagnosis is based on time-consuming criteria, burdened with subjectivity. Hence, objective and more reliable therapeutic tests are desirable for the clinical practice of Psychiatry. Since schizophrenia is characterized by progressive brain volume changes during the course of the disease, many studies have recently turned attention to machine learning and brain morphometric techniques serving as tools for computer-aided diagnosis of schizophrenia based on neuroimaging data. In our study, the methodology is applied to distinguish between 52 first-episode schizophrenia patients and 52 healthy volunteers on the basis of T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of their brains preprocessed by the means of voxel-based and deformation-based morphometry. The proposed classification schemes vary in the feature extraction and selection steps. Namely, Mann-Whitney testing is implemented as a simple univariate approach playing the role of a comparator to multivariate methods such as inter-subject PCA, the K-SVD algorithm, and pattern-based morphometry. The highest classification accuracy, 70%, is reached with the pattern-based morphometry technique. The study points out the difference between univariate and multivariate approaches towards neuroimaging data. Additionally, the contrast between feature extraction capabilities of voxel-based and deformation-based morphometry is demonstrated. © 2017, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

However, findings have not been consistent across studies in this population. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis on progressive brain volume changes in children and adolescents with EOP. Methods: A systematic literature search of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies comparing longitudinal brain volume changes in children and adolescents with EOP and healthy controls was conducted. The annualized rates of relative change in brain volume by region of interest (ROI) were used as raw data for the meta-analysis. The effect of age, sex, duration of illness, and specific diagnosis on volume change was also evaluated. Results: Five original studies with 156 EOP patients (mean age at baseline MRI in the five studies ranged from 13.3 to 16.6 years, 67.31% males) and 163 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, with a mean duration of follow-up of 2.46 years (range 2.02-3.40), were included. Frontal gray matter (GM) was the only region in which significant differences in volume change over time were found between patients and controls (Hedges' g -. 0.435, 95% confidence interval (CI): -. 0.678 to -. 0.193, p < 0.001). Younger age at baseline MRI was associated with greater loss of temporal GM volume over time in patients as compared with controls (p = 0.005). Within patients, a diagnosis of schizophrenia was related to greater occipital GM volume loss over time (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Compared with healthy individuals, EOP patients show greater progressive frontal GM loss over the first few years after illness onset. Age at baseline MRI and diagnosis of schizophrenia appear to be significant moderators of particular specific brain volume changes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Brain volume; Early-onset psychosis; Gray matter; Longitudinal; Meta-analysis; MRI","Adolescent; Brain; Child; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Psychotic Disorders; age; Article; brain size; disease duration; early onset psychosis; follow up; frontal cortex; gray matter; human; longitudinal study; meta analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occipital cortex; parietal cortex; priority journal; psychosis; schizophrenia; sex ratio; systematic review; temporal cortex; adolescent; brain; child; diagnostic imaging; growth, development and aging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; psychosis","C.

The etiopathogenesis of the AD is unclear, but a role for viral infection is suspected to play a role in initiating the disease. We recently described a positive correlation between high titers of HSV-1-specific antibodies (Ab) and the volumes of brain regions typically affected in disease. Objective: The exploration of a possible role for Herpesviridae in AD was extended by analyzing HHV-6-specific humoral immunity in individuals with AD or a diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a condition that is often prodromic of the development of AD. Methods: 59 AD, 60 aMCI, and 61 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Serum HHV-6 IgG antibody titers and avidity index were tested by ELISA. Two randomly selected subgroups of AD and aMCI in whom HHV-6 serum antibodies were detected underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by 1.5 T scanner. Results: HHV-6 seroprevalence, antibody titers, and avidity were similar in the three groups. No correlation was found between Ab titers or avidity and brain volumes, either overall or in the regions typically affected by disease. Conclusions: The lack of any relation between humoral immune response against HHV-6 and AD and aMCI seems to rule out a role for this virus in the pathogenesis of AD. © 2016-IOS Press and the authors.","Alzheimer's disease; HHV-6; humoral immunity; magnetic resonance imaging","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Antibodies; Case-Control Studies; Female; Herpesvirus 1, Human; Herpesvirus 6, Human; Humans; Immunity, Humoral; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Temporal Lobe; herpes simplex virus 1 antibody; human herpesvirus 6 antibody; immunoglobulin G; unclassified drug; virus antibody; antibody; aged; Alzheimer disease; antibody blood level; antibody titer; Article; brain region; brain size; controlled study; correlational study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; exploratory research; female; human; Human herpesvirus 6; humoral immunity; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; neuropathology; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; seroprevalence; virus immunity; virus load; virus pathogenesis; Alzheimer disease; blood; case control study; epidemiology; Herpes simplex virus 1; immunology; pathology; temporal lobe; very elderly; virology","S.

Whether OT receptor (OXTR) epigenetic alterations occur across psychotic disorders in relation to illness-related disturbances in social cognition and brain anatomy is unknown. Methods Participants with affective and nonaffective psychotic disorders (92 women, 75 men) and healthy controls (38 women, 37 men) from the Chicago site of the Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes study completed the Penn Emotion Recognition Test, a facial emotion recognition task. We measured cytosine methylation at site -934 upstream of the OXTR start codon in DNA from whole blood and for the first time their relationship with plasma OT levels assessed by enzyme-immunoassay. Volumes of brain regions supporting social cognition were measured from magnetic resonance imaging scans using FreeSurfer. Results Patients with prototypic schizophrenia features showed higher levels of DNA methylation than those with prototypic bipolar features. Methylation was higher in women than men and was associated with poorer emotion recognition only in female patients and controls. Greater methylation was associated with smaller volumes in temporal-limbic and prefrontal regions associated previously with social cognition but only in healthy women and females with schizophrenia. Conclusions DNA methylation of the OXTR site -934 was higher in schizophrenia spectrum than bipolar patients. Among patients, it was linked to behavioral deficits in social cognition and neuroanatomic structures known to support emotion processing only in schizophrenia spectrum individuals. © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry.","Emotion recognition; Epigenetics; Oxytocin; Psychosis; Sex differences; Structural imaging","cytosine; DNA; oxytocin receptor; adult; affective psychosis; Article; brain region; brain size; controlled study; DNA methylation; emotion; emotion assessment; enzyme immunoassay; female; genetic association; human; imaging software; limbic cortex; major clinical study; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Penn Emotion Recognition Test; prefrontal cortex; psychosis; recognition; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; social cognition; start codon; task performance; temporal cortex","L.H.

Quantitative analysis of brain atrophy may be useful in differentiating neurodegenerative disorders. The aim of this study was to identify the volumetric differences of subcortical structures in patients with ET and PD tremor using an automated segmentation method. Methods: Volumetric MRIs were obtained in 45 patients with ET, 45 patients with PD tremor, and 45 age- and sex-matched control subjects. The volume of the different brain structures was measured by the automated segmentation method (FreeSurfer). Results: Volumetric data obtained with automated segmentation of cerebral regions showed a significant atrophy of the cerebellum in patients with ET. Cerebellar atrophy of ET patients was more significant in the white matter than in the grey matter, and it was noted only in patients with ET having a head tremor. No volumetric differences were found between the PD group and the control group. Conclusion: Our study suggests that volumetric differences in subcortical structures using whole brain segmentation method may help to differentiate ET from PD tremor. © 2015 S.

By a Model Based MRI Alignment technique, the search space for key-point matching among different volumes has been reduced considerably. To obtain a set of invariant feature key-points from multiple brain volumes, a greedy approach has been introduced. The proposed technique has been used to generate a brain atlas by considering 30 normal human brain volumes of a population with ages ranging from 33 to 70 years. As an application, the set of invariant key-points has been used for an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. © 2014 IEEE.","3D SIFT; Alzheimer's disease; brain atlas","Brain; Medical imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; 3D SIFT; Alignment technique; Alzheimer's disease; Brain atlas; Greedy approaches; Invariant features; Key point matching; Scale invariant feature transforms; Diagnosis","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-147995097-3","","","English","Int.

However, the utility of PBVC in the differential diagnosis of dementia remains to be established. We compared PBVC in AD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and investigated associations with clinical measures. Methods 72 participants (14 DLBs, 25 ADs, and 33 healthy controls (HCs)) underwent clinical assessment and 3 Tesla T1-weighted MRI at baseline and repeated at 12 months. We used FSL-SIENA to estimate PBVC for each subject. Voxelwise analyses and ANCOVA compared PBVC between DLB and AD, while correlational tests examined associations of PBVC with clinical measures. Results AD had significantly greater atrophy over 1 year (1.8%) compared to DLB (1.0%; p = 0.01) and HC (0.9%; p < 0.01) in widespread regions of the brain including periventricular areas. PBVC was not significantly different between DLB and HC (p = 0.95). There were no differences in cognitive decline between DLB and AD. In the combined dementia group (AD and DLB), younger age was associated with higher atrophy rates (r = 0.49, p < 0.01). Conclusions AD showed a faster rate of global brain atrophy compared to DLB, which had similar rates of atrophy to HC. Among dementia subjects, younger age was associated with accelerated atrophy, reflecting more aggressive disease in younger people. PBVC could aid in differentiating between DLB and AD, however its utility as an outcome marker in DLB is limited. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Alzheimer's disease; Atrophy; Dementia; Lewy bodies; Neuroimaging","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Brain; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Lewy Body Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain atrophy; brain size; clinical article; clinical assessment; cognition; controlled study; diffuse Lewy body disease; disease association; disease course; female; follow up; frontal lobe; human; male; mental deterioration; Mini Mental State Examination; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parietal lobe; priority journal; temporal lobe; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; Alzheimer disease; atrophy; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; differential diagnosis; Lewy Body Disease; pathology","J.T.

Leptin enters the central nervous system at levels that depend on an individual's body fat. Obese people, on average, show greater brain atrophy in old age, so it is valuable to know whether brain atrophy relates to leptin levels, which can be targeted by interventions. We therefore determined how plasma leptin levels, and BMI, relate to brain structure, and whether leptin levels might account for BMI's effect on the brain. We measured regional brain volumes using tensor-based morphometry, in MRI scans of 517 elderly individuals with plasma leptin measured (mean: 13.3±0.6 ng/ml; mean age: 75.2±7.3 years; 321 men/196 women). We related plasma leptin levels to brain volumes at every location in the brain after adjusting for age, sex, and diagnosis and, later, also BMI. Plasma leptin levels were significantly higher (a) in women than men, and (b) in obese versus overweight, normal or underweight individuals. People with higher leptin levels showed deficits in frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes, brainstem, and the cerebellum, irrespective of age, sex, or diagnosis. These associations persisted after controlling for BMI. Greater brain atrophy may occur in people with central leptin insufficiency, a marker of obesity. Therapeutic manipulation of leptin may be a promising direction for slowing brain decline. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Alzheimer's disease; BMI; Brain structure; Leptin; MRI; Obesity","Adipose Tissue; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Body Mass Index; Brain; Energy Metabolism; Hormones; Humans; Leptin; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Obesity; Sex Factors; leptin; age distribution; aged; article; body mass; brain atrophy; brain size; brain stem; cerebellum; controlled study; female; frontal lobe; geriatric patient; human; image analysis; major clinical study; male; morphometrics; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; occipital lobe; parietal lobe; priority journal; sex difference; temporal lobe; underweight","P.M.

IL-6 mediated inflammatory response triggered by maternal infection or stress induces disruption of prenatal hippocampal development which might contribute towards psychopathology during adulthood. There is a substantial lack of knowledge on how genetic predisposition to elevated IL-6 expression effects hippocampal structure in schizophrenia patients. In this first-time study, we evaluated the relationship between functional polymorphism rs1800795 of IL-6 and hippocampal gray matter volume in antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenia patients in comparison with healthy controls. Methodology: We examined antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenia patients [N = 28] in comparison with healthy controls [N = 37] group matched on age, sex and handedness. Using 3 Tesla - MRI, bilateral hippocampi were manually segmented by blinded raters with good inter-rater reliability using a valid method. Additionally, Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) analysis was performed using hippocampal mask. The IL-6 level was measured in blood plasma using ELISA technique. SNP rs1800795 was genotyped using PCR and DNA sequencing. Psychotic symptoms were assessed using Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms and Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms. Results: Schizophrenia patients had significantly deficient left and right hippocampal volumes after controlling for the potential confounding effects of age, sex and total brain volume. Plasma IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients than controls. There was a significant diagnosis by rs1800795 genotype interaction involving both right and left hippocampal volumes. Interestingly, this effect was significant only in men but not in women. Conclusion: Our first time observations suggest a significant relationship between IL-6 rs1800795 and reduced hippocampal volume in antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenia. Moreover, this relationship was antithetical in healthy controls and this effect was observed in men but not in women. Together, these observations support a ""differential susceptibility"" effect of rs1800795 in schizophrenia pathogenesis mediated through hippocampal volume deficit that is of possible neurodevelopmental origin. © 2014 Kalmady et al.","","Adult; Antipsychotic Agents; Case-Control Studies; Female; Gray Matter; Hippocampus; Humans; Interleukin-6; Male; Organ Size; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Schizophrenia; interleukin 6; interleukin 6; neuroleptic agent; adult; allele; article; brain atrophy; brain size; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; DNA sequence; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; gene expression regulation; gene frequency; genetic predisposition; gray matter; hippocampus; human; human tissue; IL 6 gene; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathogenesis; polymerase chain reaction; protein blood level; psychologic assessment; schizophrenia; single nucleotide polymorphism; voxel based morphometry; case control study; genetics; hippocampus; organ size; pathology; schizophrenia; single nucleotide polymorphism","","","Public Library of Science","19326203","","POLNC","24787542","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84900386452"

CPD is naturally well suited for the analysis of data sets comprised of observations of a function of multiple discrete indices. In this study we evaluate the prospects of using CPD for modeling MRI brain properties (i.e. brain volume and gray-level) for schizophrenia diagnosis. Taking into account that 3D imaging data consists of millions of pixels per patient, the diagnosis of a schizophrenia patient based on pixel analysis constitutes a methodological challenge (e.g. multiple comparison problem). We show that the CPD could potentially be used as a dimensionality redaction method and as a discriminator between schizophrenia patients and match control, using the gradient of pre-and post Gd-T1-weighted MRI data, which is strongly correlated with cerebral blood perfusion. Our approach was tested on 68 MRI scans: 40 first-episode schizophrenia patients and 28 matched controls. The CPD subject""s scores exhibit statistically significant result (P < 0.001). In the context of diagnosing schizophrenia with MRI, the results suggest that the CPD could potentially be used to discriminate between schizophrenia patients and matched control. In addition, the CPD model suggests for brain regions that might exhibit abnormalities in schizophrenia patients for future research. © 2015 SPIE.","Candecomp/Parafac Decomposition (CPD); Morbid schizophrenia; MRI; multiple comparisons problem (MCP)","Brain; Diagnosis; Diseases; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Pixels; Analysis of data; Candecomp/parafac decompositions; Matched controls; Morbid schizophrenia; Multiple comparison; Schizophrenia patients; Vascular perfusion; Volumetric Imaging; Image processing","","Styner M.A.; Ourselin S.","SPIE","16057422","978-162841503-2","","","English","Progr.

Currently, an effective approach that allows to interpret the disease in terms of global and local changes is not available in the clinical practice. In this paper, we propose an approach for classification of brain MR images, based on finding pathology-related patterns through the identification of regional structural changes. The approach combines a probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) technique, which allows to identify image regions through latent topics inferred from the brain MR slices, with a bottom-up Graph-Based Visual Saliency (GBVS) model, which calculates maps of relevant information per region. Regional saliency maps are finally combined into a single map on each slice, obtaining a master saliency map of each brain volume. The proposed approach includes a one-to-one comparison of the saliency maps which feeds a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, to group test subjects into normal or probable AD subjects. A set of 156 brain MR images from healthy (76) and pathological (80) subjects, splitted into a training set (10 non-demented and 10 demented subjects) and one testing set (136 subjects), was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Preliminary results show that the proposed method reaches a maximum classification accuracy of 87.21% © 2013 SPIE.","Alzheimer's disease; MRI; Probabilistic latent semantic analysis; Visual attention models","Computer aided diagnosis; Image retrieval; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Pathology; Semantics; Support vector machines; Alzheimer's disease; Classification accuracy; Effective approaches; Graph-based visual saliencies; Probabilistic latent semantic analysis; Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis(PLSA); Relevant informations; Visual attention model; Image segmentation","","","","0277786X","978-081949444-3","PSISD","","English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878380067"

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are common anti-hypertensive treatments, but have differential effects on cortical amyloid. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between anti-hypertensive treatment, brain volume, and cognition, using a propensity-weighted analysis to account for confounding by indication. Methods: We identified a cohort of normal elderly adults and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD (N = 886; mean age = 75.0) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Primary outcomes were brain parenchymal fraction, total hippocampal volume, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume. Secondary outcomes were standardized scores on neuropsychological tests. Propensity-weighted adjusted multivariate linear regression was used to estimate associations between anti-hypertensive treatment class and MRI volumes and cognition. Results: Individuals treated with ARBs showed larger hippocampal volumes (R2 = 0.83, p = 0.05) and brain parenchymal fraction (R2 = 0.83, p = 0.01) than those treated with ACEIs. When stratified by diagnosis, this effect remained only in normal elderly adults and MCI patients, and a significant association between ARBs and lower WMH volume (R2 = 0.83, p = 0.03) emerged for AD patients only. ARBs were also associated with significantly better performance on tests of episodic and verbal memory, language, and executive function (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Findings are consistent with evidence for a neuroprotective effect of treatment with ARBs for brain structure and cognition. This study has potential implications for the treatment of hypertension, particularly in elderly adults at risk of cognitive decline and AD. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

To date, longitudinal changes have not been observed. The present study investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in white-matter diffusivity in relationship to the phase of prodromal Huntington's progression, and compared them with changes in brain volumes and clinical variables that track disease progression. Methods: Diffusion MRI profiles were studied for 2 years in 37 gene-negative controls and 64 prodromal Huntington's disease participants in varied phases of disease progression. To estimate the relative importance of diffusivity metrics in the prodromal phase, group effects were rank ordered relative to those obtained from analyses of brain volumes, motor, cognitive, and sensory variables. Results: First, at baseline diffusivity was abnormal throughout all tracts, especially as individuals approached a manifest Huntington's disease diagnosis. Baseline diffusivity metrics in 6 tracts and basal ganglia volumes best distinguished among the groups. Second, group differences in longitudinal change in diffusivity were localized to the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, most prominently in individuals closer to a diagnosis. Group differences were also observed in longitudinal changes of most brain volumes, but not clinical variables. Last, increases in motor symptoms across time were associated with greater changes in the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus diffusivity and corpus callosum, cerebrospinal fluid, and lateral ventricle volumes. Conclusions: These novel findings provide new insights into changes within 2 years in different facets of brain structure and their clinical relevance to changes in symptomatology that is decisive for a manifest Huntington's diagnosis. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society","brain volume; cognition; diffusion tensor imaging; Huntington's disease; motor symptoms","Adult; Basal Ganglia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Huntington Disease; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Prodromal Symptoms; White Matter; adult; Article; basal ganglion; brain function; brain size; cerebrospinal fluid; comparative study; controlled study; corpus callosum; cross-sectional study; diffusion weighted imaging; disease course; female; human; Huntington chorea; lateral brain ventricle; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; occipitofrontal fasciculus; odor recognition test; outcome assessment; priority journal; prodromal huntington disease; prodromal symptom; Stroop test; symbol digit modalities test; trail making test; Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale; University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test; white matter; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; diffusion tensor imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; disease exacerbation; Huntington chorea; longitudinal study; middle aged; pathophysiology; procedures; white matter","J.S.

The neural substrates associated with Lesch-Nyhan disease remain poorly understood. We aimed to use voxel-based morphometry to identify affected brain regions in classic Lesch-Nyhan disease and Lesch-Nyhan variant disease, and to identify regions that differ between the two disease types. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited patients with classic Lesch-Nyhan disease or Lesch-Nyhan variant disease from clinics, referrals, the Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome Registry, and the Matheny School and Hospital (Peapack, NJ, USA), and healthy controls from the Baltimore metropolitan area (MD, USA). We used voxel-based morphometry to analyse grey matter volume between groups using a three-group ANCOVA, followed by six pairwise post-hoc group comparisons. Findings: Between Oct 3, 1993, and April 29, 2013, we recruited 21 patients with classic Lesch-Nyhan disease, 17 patients with variant disease, and 33 healthy controls. Patients with classic Lesch-Nyhan disease had a 20% reduction in intracranial volume (17% reduction in grey matter volume; 26% reduction in white matter volume) compared with healthy adults. The largest differences were in basal ganglia, and frontotemporal and limbic regions, with sparing of parieto-occipital regions. Grey matter volumes of patients with Lesch-Nyhan variant disease were invariably between those of patients with classic Lesch-Nyhan disease and healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, patients with classic disease showed additional grey matter volume reductions in the temporal lobe and left lateralised structures, and patients with variant disease showed additional reductions in lingual and precuneus regions with sparing of right frontal and temporal regions. Patients with classic disease had reductions of volume in the ventral striatum and prefrontal areas compared with those with the variant form. Interpretation: We noted regional abnormalities associated with known neurological and behavioural deficits in patients with classic Lesch-Nyhan disease. Patients with Lesch-Nyhan variant disease show milder grey matter abnormalities in many of the same brain regions and preservation of grey matter volume in other regions, which could provide important clues to the neural substrates of differences between the phenotypes.

Such mistakes occur particularly in the initial stages, when ""plus syndrome"" has not yet clinically emerged. Objective: To investigate the global brain volume and tissue loss in patients with PSP relative to patients with IPD and healthy controls and correlations between clinical parameters and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived brain volume estimates. Methods: T1-weighted images were obtained from three groups of Chilean Latin American adults: 21 patients with IPD, 18 patients with PSP and 14 healthy controls. We used Structural Imaging Evaluation with Normalization of Atrophy (SIENAX) to assess white matter, gray matter and whole-brain volumes (normalized to cranial volume). Imaging data were used to analyze putative correlations with the clinical status of PSP and IPD patients using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS III), Hoehn and Yahr (H & Y), the Clinical Global Impression for Disease Severity Scale (CGI-S) and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Results: PSP patients had significantly lower whole brain volume than both IPD patients and controls. Whole brain volume reduction in PSP patients was primarily attributable to gray matter volume reduction. We found a significant correlation between brain volume reduction and clinical status in the PSP group. Conclusions: At the group level, the whole brain and gray matter volumes differentiated patients with PSP from patients with IPD. There was also significant clinical-imaging correlations with motor disturbances in PSP. © 2016 Guevara, Bulatova, Barker, Gonzalez, Crossley and Kempton.","Idiopathic Parkinson's disease; Progressive supranuclear palsy; SIENA; SIENAX; Whole brain atrophy state","levodopa; adult; aged; American; Article; brain atrophy; brain size; brain tissue; clinical article; clinical assessment tool; Clinical Global Impression for Disease Severity Scale; controlled study; female; Frontal Assessment Battery; gray matter; Hoehn and Yahr scale; human; human tissue; idiopathic disease; male; nervous system parameters; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; Parkinson disease; progressive supranuclear palsy; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; white matter","C.

The features have to accurately capture main AD-related variations of anatomical brain structures, such as, e.g., ventricles size, hippocampus shape, cortical thickness, and brain volume. This paper proposed to predict the AD with a deep 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), which can learn generic features capturing AD biomarkers and adapt to different domain datasets. The 3D-CNN is built upon a 3D convolutional autoencoder, which is pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in structural brain MRI scans. Fully connected upper layers of the 3D-CNN are then fine-tuned for each task-specific AD classification. Experiments on the CADDementia MRI dataset with no skull-stripping preprocessing have shown our 3D-CNN outperforms several conventional classifiers by accuracy. Abilities of the 3D-CNN to generalize the features learnt and adapt to other domains have been validated on the ADNI dataset. © 2016 IEEE.","3D convolutional neural network; Alzheimer's disease; Autoencoder; Brain MRI; Deep learning","Brain; Brain mapping; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Convolution; Diagnosis; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neural networks; Neurodegenerative diseases; Alzheimer's disease; Auto encoders; Brain MRI; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Image processing","E.

However, it is unclear if and how they are modulated by brain developmental stage (and, therefore, by age at FEP as a proxy). This is a multicenter cross-sectional case-control brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Patients with FEP (n = 196), 65.3% males, with a wide age at FEP span (12-35 y), and healthy controls (HC) (n = 157), matched for age, sex, and handedness, were scanned at 6 sites. Gray matter volume and thickness measurements were generated for several brain regions using FreeSurfer software. The nonlinear relationship between age at scan (a proxy for age at FEP in patients) and volume and thickness measurements was explored in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD), affective psychoses (AFP), and HC. Earlier SSD cases (ie, FEP before 15-20 y) showed significant volume and thickness deficits in frontal lobe, volume deficits in temporal lobe, and volume enlargements in ventricular system and basal ganglia. First-episode AFP patients had smaller cingulate cortex volume and thicker temporal cortex only at early age at FEP (before 18-20 y). The AFP group also had age-constant (12-35-y age span) volume enlargements in the frontal and parietal lobe. Our study suggests that age at first episode modulates the structural brain abnormalities found in FEP patients in a nonlinear and diagnosis-dependent manner. Future MRI studies should take these results into account when interpreting samples with different ages at onset and diagnosis.","Age at onset; Bipolar disorder; Cortical thickness; Cortical volume; First-episode psychosis; MRI; Schizophrenia","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Age of Onset; Case-Control Studies; Cerebral Cortex; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Gray Matter; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; affective psychosis; Article; basal ganglion; brain region; brain size; case control study; child; cingulate gyrus; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diagnosis related group; female; frontal lobe; gray matter; human; major clinical study; male; morphometrics; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; onset age; priority journal; psychosis; schizophrenia; temporal cortex; temporal lobe; age; brain cortex; clinical trial; multicenter study; onset age; pathology; psychosis; young adult","L.

Summary: The brain volume/cerebrospinal fluid index (BV/CSF index) is validated in this study as a measurement of global brain atrophy. We tested the ability of the BV/CSF index to detect global brain atrophy, investigated the influence of confounders, provided normative values and cut-offs for mild, moderate and severe brain atrophy, and studied associations with different outcome variables. A total of 1,009 individuals were included [324 healthy controls, 408 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 277 patients with AD]. Magnetic resonance images were segmented using FreeSurfer, and the BV/CSF index was calculated and studied both cross-sectionally and longitudinally (1-year follow-up). Both AD patients and MCI patients who progressed to AD showed greater global brain atrophy compared to stable MCI patients and controls. Atrophy was associated with older age, larger intracranial volume, less education and presence of the ApoE ε4 allele. Significant correlations were found with clinical variables, CSF biomarkers and several cognitive tests. Key Messages: The BV/CSF index may be useful for staging individuals according to the degree of global brain atrophy, and for monitoring disease progression. It also shows potential for predicting clinical changes and for being used in the clinical routine.Background: Effective therap. © 2015 S.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative is a longitudinal, multicenter study that is evaluating a range of biomarkers for use in diagnosis of AD, prediction of patient outcomes, and clinical trials. These biomarkers include brain metrics derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography scans as well as metrics derived from blood and cerebrospinal fluid. We focus on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative studies published between 2011 and March 2013 for which structural MRI was a major outcome measure. Our main goal was to review key articles offering insights into progression of AD and the relationships of structural MRI measures to cognition and to other biomarkers in AD. In Supplement 1, we also discuss genetic and environmental risk factors for AD and exciting new analysis tools for the efficient evaluation of large-scale structural MRI data sets such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data. © 2014 Society of Biological Psychiatry.","Alzheimer's disease; atrophy; biomarkers; brain volume; cognition; cognitive decline; conversion; dementia; hippocampus; magnetic resonance imaging; mild cognitive impairment; MRI; predict; progression; temporal lobe","Alzheimer Disease; Biological Markers; Brain; Cognition; Disease Progression; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Alzheimer's disease; atrophy; biomarkers; brain volume; cognition; cognitive decline; conversion; dementia; hippocampus; magnetic resonance imaging; mild cognitive impairment; MRI; predict; progression; temporal lobe; Alzheimer disease; cognition; cognitive defect; diagnosis related group; disease course; disease marker; environmental factor; genetic risk; human; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; priority journal; review; risk factor","P.M.

Consequently, a rapidly increasing number of software tools have become available. We tested whether modifications of simple MR protocol parameters typically used in clinical routine systematically bias automated brain MRI segmentation results. Methods: The study was approved by the local ethical committee and included 20 consecutive patients (13 females, mean age 75.8 ± 13.8 years) undergoing clinical brain MRI at 1.5 T for workup of cognitive decline. We compared three 3D T1 magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequences with the following parameter settings: ADNI-2 1.2 mm iso-voxel, no image filtering, LOCAL− 1.0 mm iso-voxel no image filtering, LOCAL+ 1.0 mm iso-voxel with image edge enhancement. Brain segmentation was performed by two different and established analysis tools, FreeSurfer and MorphoBox, using standard parameters. Results: Spatial resolution (1.0 versus 1.2 mm iso-voxel) and modification in contrast resulted in relative estimated volume difference of up to 4.28 % (p < 0.001) in cortical gray matter and 4.16 % (p < 0.01) in hippocampus. Image data filtering resulted in estimated volume difference of up to 5.48 % (p < 0.05) in cortical gray matter. Conclusion: A simple change of MR parameters, notably spatial resolution, contrast, and filtering, may systematically bias results of automated brain MRI morphometry of up to 4–5 %. This is in the same range as early disease-related brain volume alterations, for example, in Alzheimer disease. Automated brain segmentation software packages should therefore require strict MR parameter selection or include compensatory algorithms to avoid MR parameter-related bias of brain morphometry results. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","Aged; Algorithms; Artifacts; Brain; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Organ Size; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; aged; Article; autoanalysis; brain size; brain ventricle; cerebellum; clinical article; contrast enhancement; controlled study; female; gray matter; hippocampus; human; image quality; image segmentation; imaging software; male; measurement error; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; optical resolution; priority journal; volumetry; white matter; algorithm; artifact; automated pattern recognition; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; image enhancement; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging","S.

Method: Longitudinal percentage of brain volume changes (PBVC) in two-year follow up and its intermediate counterparts in early 6-month and late 18-month are used as features in supervised and unsupervised classification procedures based on K-mean, fuzzy clustering method (FCM) and support vector machine (SVM). The most relevant features for classification are selected using discriminative analysis (DA) of features and their principal components (PC). Accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated in a group of 30 patients with AD (16 males, 14 females, age. ±. standard-deviation (SD). =. 75. ±. 1.36 years) and 30 normal controls (15 males, 15 females, age. ±. SD. =. 77. ±. 0.88 years) using leave-one-out cross-validation. Results: Results indicate superiority of supervised machine learning techniques over unsupervised ones in diagnosing AD and withal, predominance of RBF kernel over lineal one. Accuracies of 83.3%, 83.3%, 90% and 91.7% are achieved in classification by K-mean, FCM, linear SVM and SVM with radial based function (RBF) respectively. Conclusion: Evidence that SVM classification of longitudinal atrophy rates may results in high accuracy is given. Additionally, it is realized that use of intermediate atrophy rates and their principal components improves diagnostic accuracy. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Alzheimer's disease; Diagnostic; FCM; Longitudinal atrophy; MRI; SVM","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Brain; Cluster Analysis; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Principal Component Analysis; Support Vector Machine; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain size; classification algorithm; classifier; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; follow up; fuzzy clustering method; human; kernel method; longitudinal brain atrophy pattern; machine learning; male; mathematical computing; nervous system parameters; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; principal component analysis; priority journal; radial based function; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; validation study; Alzheimer disease; atrophy; brain; cluster analysis; pathology; procedures; support vector machine","A.

Pre-and perinatal adversities may increase the risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Hypoxia-related obstetric complications (OCs) are associated with brain anatomical abnormalities in schizophrenia, but their association with brain anatomy variation in bipolar disorder is unknown. Method. Magnetic resonance imaging brain scans, clinical examinations and data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway were obtained for 219 adults, including 79 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder (age 29.4 years, s.d. = 11.8 years, 39% male) and 140 healthy controls (age 30.8 years, s.d. = 12.0 years, 53% male). Severe hypoxia-related OCs throughout pregnancy/birth and perinatal asphyxia were each studied in relation to a priori selected brain volumes (hippocampus, lateral ventricles and amygdala, obtained with FreeSurfer), using linear regression models covarying for age, sex, medication use and intracranial volume. Multiple comparison adjustment was applied. Results. Perinatal asphyxia was associated with smaller left amygdala volume (t =-2.59, p = 0.012) in bipolar disorder patients, but not in healthy controls. Patients with psychotic bipolar disorder showed distinct associations between perinatal asphyxia and smaller left amygdala volume (t =-2.69, p = 0.010), whereas patients with non-psychotic bipolar disorder showed smaller right hippocampal volumes related to both perinatal asphyxia (t =-2.60, p = 0.015) and severe OCs (t =-3.25, p = 0.003). No associations between asphyxia or severe OCs and the lateral ventricles were found. Conclusions. Pre-and perinatal hypoxia-related OCs are related to brain morphometry in bipolar disorder in adulthood, with specific patterns in patients with psychotic versus non-psychotic illness.

Rodent models have proven to be invaluable in advancing our understanding of the human brain, and will almost certainly play a pivotal role in future studies on postnatal neurodevelopment. The growing field of magnetic resonance microscopy has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of neurodevelopment, if it can be successfully and appropriately assimilated into the vast body of existing neuroscience research. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of a developmental neuro-ontology designed specifically for tracking regional changes in MR biomarkers throughout postnatal neurodevelopment. Using this ontological classification as a segmentation guide, we track regional changes in brain volume in rats between postnatal day zero and postnatal day 80 and demonstrate differential growth rates in axial versus paraxial brain regions.

However, association between regional brain volume change and cognitive decline of PD is uncertain. Purpose: To compare regional brain volume difference between PD without dementia (PDND) and PD with dementia (PDD). Material and Methods: We enrolled 16 normal controls (mean±SD: 69.5±6.31) and 32 sex-, age-matched patients with PD (16 PDND and 16 PDD patients with Hoehn & Yahr stage II or III). Cognitive function was assessed using mini-mental status examination (MMSE). Intracranial volume (ICV) and the hippocampal volumes were manually measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Regional gray/white matter volume changes were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry. Results: Age, ICV, volume of gray matter volume (GMV), white matter, and hippocampi did not differ among the three groups. The regional GMV of PDD was significantly decreased in the areas of right middle frontal gyrus, short insular gyri, superior temporal gyri; both precuneus compared to PDND (uncorrected P < 0.001). In the partial correlation analysis (controlled for age, sex, ICV), regional GMV of PD was positively correlated with MMSE score in the areas of short insular gyri, right circular insular sulcus, right calcarine sulcus, left superior temporal gyrus (planum porale), and left inferior precentral sulcus (uncorrected P < 0.001). Conclusion: We suggest that the volume loss of hippocampus may not be a finding in developing of PDD while variation of the regional volume of the frontal, insular cortex, superior temporal gyri, and precuneus lobes may be a phenomenon of PDD.","Dementia; Gray matter; Parkinson's disease; Regional volume; White matter","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Cognition Disorders; Dementia; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Parkinson Disease; Brain; Correlation methods; Magnetic resonance imaging; Dementia; Gray matter; Parkinson's disease; Regional volume; White matter; aged; brain; case control study; Cognition Disorders; complication; computer assisted diagnosis; dementia; female; human; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; Parkinson disease; pathology; procedures; very elderly; Neurodegenerative diseases","S.S.

The existing research works have utilized gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid tissues individually for diagnosis of PD and have ignored the intercorrelation among the three tissues. Thus, there is a need to define a fused feature descriptor (FFD) which can capture information and intercorrelation of all the three tissues simultaneously, and to further enhance the performance of CAD. The present study proposes a simple and efficient FFD, in terms of all the three tissues, for CAD of PD. Each brain volume is represented in terms of the FFD. Then each fused volume is segmented into 118 brain regions. Thereafter, features extraction is carried out from each brain region using 3D local binary pattern. Then, a set of discriminating and uncorrelated features are identified using t-test in conjunction with minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection method. Finally, support vector machine is utilized to build a decision model. Volumetric 3D T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging dataset (age & gender matched 30 PD and 30 healthy subjects) is acquired using 1.5T machine and is utilized to investigate the efficacy of the proposed method. The classification accuracy of 95% is achieved using leave-one-out cross-validation scheme which is superior to the existing methods. Regions namely Hippocampus_R, Cingulum_Mid_L, Frontal_Inf_Tri_L, Precentral_R, Precentral_L, Frontal_Mid_L, Frontal_Mid_Orb_L, Cingulum_Ant_L and Hippocampus_L, are observed to be the most discriminative regions for diagnosis of PD. The notable performance of the proposed method suggests that instead of studying the three tissues independently, their intercorrelation should also be considered. Further, the proposed method may be employed as a diagnostic tool for diagnosis of PD. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","3D local binary pattern; Computer-aided diagnosis; Fused feature descriptor; Magnetic resonance imaging; Minimum redundancy maximum relevance; Parkinson's disease","3D modeling; Brain; Cerebrospinal fluid; Histology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Magnetism; Neurodegenerative diseases; Pattern recognition; Redundancy; Resonance; Statistical methods; Support vector machines; Tissue; Classification accuracy; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Feature descriptors; Leave-one-out cross validations; Local binary patterns; Minimum redundancy-maximum relevances; Parkinson's disease; T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging; adult; aged; Article; brain region; brain size; cingulum (brain); clinical article; computer assisted radiography; controlled study; differential diagnosis; extraction; frontal lobe; hippocampus; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; priority journal; Student t test; support vector machine; three dimensional imaging; volumetry; Computer aided diagnosis","B.

Whole-brain volumetric reductions are almost universally reported by most studies irrespective of the characteristics of the samples studied (e.g., chronic/recent-onset; medicated/neuroleptic-naïve etc.). However, the same cannot be said of the reported regional morphometric abnormalities in schizophrenia. While certain regional morphometric abnormalities are more frequently reported than others, there are no such abnormalities that are universally reported across studies. Variability of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics across study samples as well as technical and methodological issues related to acquisition and analyses of brain structural images may contribute to inconsistency of brain morphometric findings in schizophrenia. The objective of the present study therefore was to systematically examine brain morphometry in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia to find out if there are significant whole-brain or regional volumetric differences detectable at the appropriate significance threshold, after attempting to control for various confounding factors that could impact brain volumes. Methods: Structural magnetic resonance images of 90 subjects (schizophrenia∈=∈45; healthy subjects∈=∈45) were acquired using a 3 Tesla magnet. Morphometric analyses were carried out following standard analyses pipelines of three most commonly used strategies, viz., whole-brain voxel-based morphometry, whole-brain surface-based morphometry, and between-group comparisons of regional volumes generated by automated segmentation and parcellation. Results: In our sample of patients having recent-onset schizophrenia with limited neuroleptic exposure, there were no significant whole brain or regional brain morphometric abnormalities noted at the appropriate statistical significance thresholds with or without including age, gender and intracranial volume or total brain volume in the statistical analyses. Conclusions: In the background of the conflicting findings in the literature, our findings indicate that brain morphometric abnormalities may not be directly related to the schizophrenia phenotype. Analysis of the reasons for the inconsistent results across studies as well as consideration of alternate sources of variability of brain morphology in schizophrenia such as epistatic and epigenetic mechanisms could perhaps advance our understanding of structural brain alterations in schizophrenia. © 2015 John et al.","","Adolescent; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Early Diagnosis; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Schizophrenia; Young Adult; risperidone; adolescent; adult; age; Article; brain size; cerebellum; clinical article; controlled study; cuneus; female; fusiform gyrus; human; inferior frontal gyrus; insula; limbic cortex; lingual gyrus; male; middle frontal gyrus; middle occipital gyrus; middle temporal gyrus; morphometrics; neuroimaging; neurologic examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parahippocampal gyrus; paranoia; pathological anatomy; phenotype; posterior cingulate; recent onset schizophrenia; region of interest based morphometry; schizophrenia; schizophreniform disorder; surface based morphometry; uncus; voxel based morphometry; brain; brain mapping; early diagnosis; middle aged; organ size; pathology; procedures; schizophrenia; young adult","","","BioMed Central Ltd.","14775751","","","26065881","English","J.

This work presents a classification scheme, based both on size and shape features extracted from brain volumes, to determine different aging stages: healthy control (HC) adults, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three support vector machines were optimized and validated for the pair-wise separation of these three classes, using selected features from a set of 3D discrete compactness measures and normalized volumes of several global and local anatomical structures. Our analysis show classification rates of up to 98.3% between HC and AD; of 85% between HC and MCI and of 93.3% for MCI and AD separation. These results outperform those reported in the literature and demonstrate the viability of the proposed morphological indexes to classify different aging stages. © 2014 SPIE.","Alzheimer disease; Discrete Compactness; MCI; Normalized Volume; Support Vector Machine","Image processing; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Structure (composition); Alzheimer disease; Anatomical structures; Classification rates; Classification scheme; Discrete Compactness; MCI; Mild cognitive impairments (MCI); Normalized Volume; Support vector machines","V.

Objectives: 1) To statistically examine neuropsychological data to determine dementia subgroups for individuals clinically diagnosed with AD or VaD and then 2) examine group differences in specific gray/white matter regions of interest. Methods: A k-means cluster analysis requested a 3-group solution from neuropsychological data acquired from individuals diagnosed clinically with AD/VaD. MRI measures of hippocampal, caudate, ventricular, subcortical lacunar infarction, whole brain volume, and leukoaraiosis (LA) were analyzed. Three regions of LA volumes were quantified and these included the periventricular (5mm around the ventricles), infracortical (5mm beneath the gray matter), and deep (between periventricular and infracortical) regions. Results: Cluster analysis sorted AD/VaD patients into single domain amnestic (n=41), single-domain dysexecutive (n=26), and multi-domain (n=26) phenotypes. Multi-domain patients exhibited worst performance on language tests; however, multi-domain patients were equally impaired on memory tests when compared to amnestic patients. Statistically-determined groups dissociated using neuroradiological parameters: amnestic and multi-domain groups presented with smaller hippocampal volume while the dysexecutive group presented with greater deep, periventricular, and whole brain LA. Neither caudate nor lacunae volume differed by group. Caudate nucleus volume negatively correlated with total LA in the dysexecutive and multi-domain groups. Conclusions: There are at least three distinct subtypes embedded within patients diagnosed clinically with AD/VaD spectrum dementia. We encourage future research to assess a) the neuroradiological substrates underlying statistically-determined AD/VaD spectrum dementia and b) how statistical modeling can be integrated into existing diagnostic criteria. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

This may have a detrimental effect on illness course and may be a predictor of subsequent conversion to AD. Although neuropsychological correlates have been widely investigated, no evidence of a neuroanatomical basis of the phenomenon has been reported yet. This study was aimed at investigating the neuroanatomical correlates of deficit awareness in amnestic MCI to determine whether they constitute risk factors for conversion to AD. Method: A sample of 36 first-diagnosis amnestic MCI patients were followed for five years. At the first diagnostic visit they were administered an extensive diagnostic and clinical procedure and the Memory Insight Questionnaire (MIQ), measuring a total index and four sub-indices, to investigate awareness of deficits in dementia; they also underwent a high resolution T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) investigation. Grey matter brain volumes were analysed on a voxel-by-voxel basis using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8. Data of 10 converter patients (CONV) and those of 26 non converter patients (NOCONV) were analysed using multiple regression models. Results: At baseline, self-awareness of memory deficits was poorer in CONV compared to NOCONV. Furthermore, reduced awareness of cognitive deficits in CONV correlated with reduced grey matter volume of the anterior cingulate (memory deficit awareness), right pars triangularis of the inferior frontal cortex (memory deficit awareness) and cerebellar vermis (total awareness), whereas in NOCONV it correlated with reduced grey matter volume of left superior (total awareness) and middle (language deficit awareness) temporal areas. Further, at baseline self-awareness of memory deficits were poorer in CONV than in NOCONV. Conclusions: Defective awareness of cognitive deficits is underpinned by different mechanisms in CONV and NOCONV amnestic MCI patients. Our data support the hypothesis that poor awareness of cognitive deficit is a predictor of subsequent conversion to AD. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Brain volume; Dementia; Mild cognitive impairment; Neuroimaging; Self-awareness","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Awareness; Brain; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory; Middle Aged; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Neuropsychological Tests; aged; Alzheimer disease; anosognosia; anterior cingulate; Article; attitude to illness; brain size; cerebellum vermis; clinical article; Clinical Dementia Rating; diagnostic procedure; follow up; frontal cortex; functional assessment; gray matter; human; image analysis; image processing; mild cognitive impairment; neuroanatomy; neurologic examination; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pars triangularis; self concept; adult; Alzheimer disease; awareness; brain; disease course; female; male; memory; middle aged; mild cognitive impairment; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; very elderly","","","Masson SpA","00109452","","CRTXA","25481475","English","Cortex","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84914102808"

The brain damage can be detected using brain volume and whole brain form. The correlation between brain shrinkage and reduction of brain volume can affect to deformation texture. In this research, the enhancement texture approach was proposed, called advanced local binary pattern (ALBP) method. ALBP is introduced as a 2D and 3D feature extraction descriptor. In the ALBP, sign and magnitude value were introduced as an enhancement to the previous LBP method. Due to a great number of features are produced by ALBP, the principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis are used as feature selection method. Furthermore, SVM classifier is applied for multiclass classification including Alzheimer's, mild cognitive impairment, and normal condition of whole brain and hippocampus. The experimental results from two scenarios (ALBP sign magnitude (2D) and ALBP sign magnitude using three orthogonal planes (3D) methods) show better accuracy and performance compare to previous method. Our proposed method achieved the average value of accuracy between 80% - 100% for both the whole brain and hippocampus data. In addition, uniform rotation invariant ALBP sign magnitude using three orthogonal planes as a 3D descriptor also outperforms other approaches with an average accuracy of 96.28% for multiclass classifications for whole brain image. © 2016 IEEE.","Alzheimer's disease; Local binary pattern; Magnetic resonance image (MRI); Mild cognitive impairment; Texture analysis","Binary images; Bins; Brain; Brain mapping; Classification (of information); Damage detection; Feature extraction; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Alzheimer's disease; Local binary patterns; Magnetic resonance images (MRI); Mild cognitive impairments; Texture analysis; Principal component analysis","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-150900619-9","85OFA","","English","Proc Int Jt Conf Neural Networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007212221"

Using tensor-based morphometry (TBM), we examined brain volume differences between presymptomatic and symptomatic FAD mutation carriers and non-carrier (NC) relatives. Methods: Twenty-five mutation carriers and 10 NC relatives underwent brain MRI and clinical assessment. Four mutation carriers had dementia (MUT-Dem), 12 had amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MUT-aMCI) and nine were cognitively normal (MUT-Norm). TBM brain volume maps of MUT-Norm, MUT-aMCI and MUT-Dem subjects were compared to NC subjects. Results: MUT-Norm subjects exhibited significantly smaller volumes in the thalamus, caudate and putamen. MUT-aMCI subjects had smaller volumes in the thalamus, splenium and pons, but not in the caudate or putamen. MUT-Dem subjects demonstrated smaller volumes in temporal, parietal and left frontal regions. As non-demented carriers approached the expected age of dementia diagnosis, this was associated with larger ventricular and caudate volumes and a trend towards smaller temporal lobe volume. Conclusions: Cognitively intact FAD mutation carriers had lower thalamic, caudate and putamen volumes, and we found preliminary evidence for increasing caudate size during the predementia stage. These regions may be affected earliest during prodromal stages of FAD, while cortical atrophy may occur in later stages, when carriers show cognitive deficits. Further studies of this population will help us understand the progression of neurobiological changes in AD.","","adult; Alzheimer disease; amnesia; article; brain; brain size; brain ventricle; caudate nucleus; clinical article; clinical assessment; controlled study; dementia; familial disease; female; frontal lobe; gene mutation; heterozygote; human; male; mild cognitive impairment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parietal lobe; pons; priority journal; putamen; splenium; symptom; temporal lobe; thalamus","G.J.

We aimed to study the use of hippocampal volume, entorhinal cortex (ERC) thickness, and whole brain volume (WBV) as predictors of cognitive change in patients with AD. 120 AD subjects, 106 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 99 non demented controls (NDC) from the multi-center pan-European AddNeuroMed study underwent MRI scanning at baseline and clinical evaluations at quarterly follow-up up to 1 year. The rate of cognitive decline was estimated using cognitive outcomes, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer disease assessment scale-cognitive (ADAS-cog) by fitting a random intercept and slope model. AD subjects had smaller ERC thickness and hippocampal and WBV volumes compared to MCI and NDC subjects. Within the AD group, ERC > WBV was significantly associated with baseline cognition (MMSE, ADAS-cog) and disease severity (Clinical Dementia Rating). Baseline ERC thickness was associated with both longitudinal MMSE and ADAS-cog score changes and WBV with ADAS-cog decline. These data indicate that AD subjects with thinner ERC had lower baseline cognitive scores, higher disease severity, and predicted greater subsequent cognitive decline at one year follow up. ERC is a region known to be affected early in the disease. Therefore, the rate of atrophy in this structure is expected to be higher since neurodegeneration begins earlier. Focusing on structural analyses that predict decline can identify those individuals at greatest risk for future cognitive loss. This may have potential for increasing the efficacy of early intervention. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

When dealing with data from various sources, it is crucial that these tools are robust for many different imaging protocols. In this study, we tested the robustness of a multiple-atlas, likelihood fusion algorithm using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data with six different protocols, comprising three manufacturers and two magnetic field strengths. The entire brain was parceled into five different levels of granularity. In each level, which defines a set of brain structures, ranging from eight to 286 regions, we evaluated the variability of brain volumes related to the protocol, age, and diagnosis (healthy or Alzheimer's disease). Our results indicated that, with proper pre-processing steps, the impact of different protocols is minor compared to biological effects, such as age and pathology. A precise knowledge of the sources of data variation enables sufficient statistical power and ensures the reliability of an anatomical analysis when using this automated brain parcellation tool on datasets from various imaging protocols, such as clinical databases. © 2015 Liang et al.","","Age Factors; Algorithms; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Brain Mapping; Databases, Factual; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; adult; age distribution; aged; algorithm; Alzheimer disease; Article; automation; brain multi atlas parcellation tool; brain size; clinical protocol; comparative study; controlled study; cross protocol stability; diencephalon; factual database; human; image analysis; image processing; imaging system; likelihood fusion algorithm; magnetic field; major clinical study; measurement accuracy; middle aged; neuroanatomy; neuroimaging; parameters; pathological anatomy; quality control procedures; reliability; reproducibility; robustness; telencephalon; three dimensional imaging; very elderly; age; Alzheimer disease; brain; brain mapping; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures; standards","","","Public Library of Science","19326203","","POLNC","26208327","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941712066"

Engaging in a deeper understanding of how antipsychotics act on the brain and body, at the cellular, molecular and physiological level is vital to comprehend both the beneficial and potentially harmful actions of these medications and stimulate development of novel therapeutics. To address this, we review recent advances in our understanding of neuroadaptations to antipsychotics, focusing on (1) treatment efficacy, (2) impact on brain volume and (3) evidence from human post-mortem studies that attempt to dissect neuropathological effects of antipsychotic drugs from organic schizophrenia neurobiology and (4) cardio-metabolic side effects. Our aim is to stimulate discussion on these highly clinically relevant topics and consider how we might use current and evolving knowledge and new methodologies in the fields of neuropharmacology and neuroscience, to advance our understanding of the long-term impact of antipsychotic treatment.

However, a large group of subjects with normal β-amyloid biomarkers have evidence of brain injury; we labeled them as the ""suspected non-Alzheimer pathophysiology"" (sNAP) group. The characteristics of the sNAP group are poorly understood. Methods: Using the preclinical AD classification, 430 cognitively normal subjects from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who underwent brain magnetic resonance (MR), 18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), and Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PET) were evaluated for FDG PET regional volumetrics, MR regional brain volumetrics, white matter hyperintensity volume, and number of infarcts. We examined cross-sectional associations across AD preclinical stages, those with all biomarkers normal, and the sNAP group. Results: The sNAP group had a lower proportion (14%) with apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype than the preclinical AD stages 2 + 3. The sNAP group did not show any group differences compared to stages 2 + 3 of the preclinical AD group on measures of FDG PET regional hypometabolism, MR regional brain volume loss, cerebrovascular imaging lesions, vascular risk factors, imaging changes associated with α-synucleinopathy, or physical findings of parkinsonism. Interpretation: Cognitively normal persons with brain injury biomarker abnormalities, with or without abnormal levels of β-amyloid, were indistinguishable on a variety of imaging markers, clinical features, and risk factors. The initial appearance of brain injury biomarkers that occurs in cognitively normal persons with preclinical AD may not depend on β-amyloidosis. © 2013 American Neurological Association.","","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biological Markers; Brain; Cerebral Cortex; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Humans; Male; Positron-Emission Tomography; Risk Factors; Synucleins; alpha synuclein; amyloid beta protein; apolipoprotein E4; biological marker; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; Pittsburgh compound B; aged; Alzheimer disease; angina pectoris; angioplasty; article; brain atrophy; brain infarction; brain injury; brain size; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; clinical feature; congestive heart failure; coronary artery bypass surgery; coronary artery disease; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; female; genotype; heart atrium fibrillation; heart infarction; human; hypertension; male; neuroimaging; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parkinsonism; positron emission tomography; priority journal; smoking; white matter","D.S.

Objective: To evaluate a stratification method on different cohorts and to investigate whether stratification in amnestic MCI could improve prediction accuracy. Methods: We identified 80 and 79 patients with amnestic MCI from different cohorts, respectively. They underwent baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scans. We performed hierarchical clustering with three imaging biomarkers: Brain volume on MRI, left hippocampus grey matter loss on MRI, and left inferior temporal gyrus glucose hypometabolism on FDG-PET. Regions-of-interest for biomarkers were defined by the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas. We performed voxel-wise statistical parametric mapping to explore differences between clusters in patterns of grey matter loss and glucose hypometabolism. We compared time to progression using an interval-censored parametric model. We evaluated predictive performance using logistic regression. Results: Similar clusters were found in different cohorts. MCI1 had the healthiest biomarker profile of cognitive performance and imaging biomarkers. MCI2 had cognitive performance and MRI measures intermediate between those of nonconverters and converters. MCI3 showed the severest reduction in brain volume and left hippocampal atrophy. MCI4 showed remarkable glucose hypometabolism in the left inferior temporal gyrus, and also demonstrated significant decreases in most cognitive scores, including non-memory functions. MCI4 showed the highest risk for progression. The prediction of progression of MCI2 especially benefited from the stratification. Conclusion: Stratification with imaging biomarkers in amnestic MCI can be a good approach for improving predictive performance. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

This study is the first to investigate how cannabis use is related to the cingulum volume, a brain region involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, in a sample of both at-risk mental state (ARMS) and first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects. A cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of manually traced cingulum in 23 FEP and 37 ARMS subjects was performed. Cannabis use was assessed with the Basel Interview for Psychosis. By using repeated measures analyses of covariance, we investigated whether current cannabis use is associated with the cingulum volume, correcting for age, gender, alcohol consumption, whole brain volume and antipsychotic medication. There was a significant three-way interaction between region (anterior/posterior cingulum), hemisphere (left/right cingulum) and cannabis use (yes/no). Post-hoc analyses revealed that this was due to a significant negative effect of cannabis use on the volume of the posterior cingulum which was independent of the hemisphere and diagnostic group and all other covariates we controlled for. In the anterior cingulum, we found a significant negative effect only for the left hemisphere, which was again independent of the diagnostic group. Overall, we found negative associations of current cannabis use with grey matter volume of the cingulate cortex, a region rich in cannabinoid CB1 receptors. As this finding has not been consistently found in healthy controls, it might suggest that both ARMS and FEP subjects are particularly sensitive to exogenous activation of these receptors. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","At-risk mental state (ARMS); Cingulum; First episode psychosis (FEP); Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Marijuana Abuse; Psychotic Disorders; Reproducibility of Results; Young Adult; At-risk mental state (ARMS); Cingulum; First episode psychosis (FEP); Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); cannabinoid 1 receptor; cannabis; neuroleptic agent; olanzapine; risperidone; adult; age; alcohol consumption; article; brain region; brain size; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; cannabis smoking; cingulate gyrus; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; diagnosis related group; drug use; female; follow up; gender; gray matter; human; interrater reliability; intrarater reliability; left hemisphere; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; mental health; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathogenesis; priority journal; psychosis; right hemisphere; schizophrenia; sex","A.

Purpose of the study is to estimate the volume of segmented caudate nucleus from MR images and to correlate the variation in the segmented volume with respect to the total brain volume. We have also tried to evaluate the caudate nucleus atrophy with the age related atrophy of white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a group of Alzheimer's disease patients. Methods 3D fast low angle shot (3D FLASH) brain MR images of 15 AD patients, 15 normal volunteers and 15 patients who had normally diagnosed MR images were included in the study. Brain tissue and caudate nuclei were segmented using the statistical parametric mapping package and a semi-automatic tool, respectively and the volumes were estimated. Volume of segmented caudate nucleus is correlated with respect to the total brain volume. Further, the caudate nucleus atrophy is estimated with the age related atrophy of WM, GM and CSF in a group of AD patients. Results Significant reduction in the caudate volume of AD patients was observed compared to that of the normal volunteers. Statistical analysis also showed significant variation in the volume of GM and CSF of AD patients. Among the patients who had normal appearing brain, 33% showed significant changes in the caudate volume. We hypothesize that these changes can be considered as an indication of early AD. Conclusion The method of volumetric analysis of brain structures is simple and effective way of early diagnosis of neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease. We have illustrated this with the observed changes in the volume of caudate nucleus in a group of patients. A detailed study with more subjects will be useful in correlating these results for early diagnosis of AD. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Alzheimer's disease; Caudate nucleus; Caudate volume; Image segmentation","adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; article; brain atrophy; brain size; brain tissue; caudate nucleus; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical article; controlled study; female; gray matter; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; white matter","R.S.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRI scans from 20 normal control subjects, 20 Alzheimer's disease patients, and 20 mild traumatically brain-injured patients were analyzed with NeuroQuant® and with FreeSurfer. Intermethod reliability was evaluated. RESULTS: Pairwise correlation coefficients, intraclass correlation coefficients, and effect size differences were computed. NeuroQuant® versus FreeSurfer measures showed excellent to good intermethod reliability for the 21 regions evaluated (r: .63 to .99/ICC: .62 to .99/ES: -.33 to 2.08) except for the pallidum (r/ICC/ES = .31/.29/-2.2) and cerebellar white matter (r/ICC/ES = .31/.31/.08). Volumes reported by NeuroQuant were generally larger than those reported by FreeSurfer with the whole brain parenchyma volume reported by NeuroQuant 6.50% larger than the volume reported by FreeSurfer. There was no systematic difference in results between the 3 subgroups. CONCLUSION: NeuroQuant® and FreeSurfer showed good to excellent intermethod reliability in volumetric measurements for all brain regions examined with the only exceptions being the pallidum and cerebellar white matter. This finding was robust for normal individuals, patients with Alzheimer's disease, and patients with mild traumatic brain injury. © 2015 by the American Society of Neuroimaging.","Brain morphometry; Freesurfer; Neuroquant<sup>®</sup>; Pallidum; Reliability","Aged; Algorithms; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Organ Size; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Software; aged; Alzheimer disease; amygdaloid nucleus; Article; automation; brain size; brain stem; caudate nucleus; cerebellum; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; correlation coefficient; diencephalon; effect size; female; forebrain; globus pallidus; gray matter; hippocampus; human; imaging software; lateral brain ventricle; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; putamen; reliability; thalamus; traumatic brain injury; white matter; algorithm; automated pattern recognition; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; evaluation study; image enhancement; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; software; three dimensional imaging","A.L.

Recent studies have reported inconsistent peripheral TREM2 mRNA expression levels and relationship with cognitive scores in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Additionally, no study has examined the association of peripheral TREM2 levels with neuroimaging measures in AD and MCI. Objective: To determine peripheral TREM2 mRNA levels in AD, amnestic MCI (aMCI) and healthy controls, and the association with cognitive performance and brain structural changes. Methods: We measured peripheral TREM2 mRNA levels in 80 AD, 30 aMCI, and 86 healthy controls using real time polymerase chain reaction. TREM2 levels were correlated with various cognitive performance and brain volumes, correcting for APOE4 status. Results: TREM2 mRNA levels were significantly higher in AD compared to controls and aMCI. Levels did not differ between aMCI and controls. Corrected for APOE4, higher TREM2 levels correlated with lower Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and episodic memory scores, and lower total grey matter and right hippocampal volumes. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analysis found negative association between TREM2 mRNA levels and grey matter volumes in temporal, parietal and frontal regions. AD subjects with MoCA scores ≤20 had higher TREM2 levels correlating with smaller total grey matter, left hippocampal and right hippocampal volumes. Conclusion: Peripheral TREM2 mRNA levels are higher in AD and are associated with AD-related cognitive deficits and hippocampal atrophy. Our findings suggest that TREM2 may be a potential non-invasive peripheral biomarker for AD diagnosis. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

We therefore examined the relation between dysglycemia and brain volume and vascular lesions on MRI in a memory clinic population. Methods The relations between markers of glycemia (HbA1c and fasting glucose levels) and normalized brain volume, medial temporal lobe atrophy and vascular lesions (white matter hyperintensities, lacunes) were assessed in 274 consecutive patients attending a memory clinic, using linear regression analyses. Results Clinical diagnoses were subjective complaints (n = 117), mild cognitive impairment (n = 62), Alzheimer's disease (n = 61) and other type of dementia (n = 34). Twenty patients had a history of diabetes. Across the whole study population there was no relation between HbA1c or fasting glucose and the brain MRI measurements, after adjustments for age, sex and diagnostic group. Secondary analyses after stratification by diabetes status, diagnosis and median age (67 years) did not change the results. Conclusion In this memory clinic population, dysglycemia was not associated with either brain volume or vascular lesions. Apparently, dysglycemia is not associated with a specific class of brain pathology in patients with cognitive complaints. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Alzheimer's disease; Brain atrophy; Diabetes; Glucose; HbA1c; Hippocampus; Lacunes; Mild cognitive impairment; White matter hyperintensities","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Blood Glucose; Brain; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Female; Glucose Metabolism Disorders; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Organ Size; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; glucose blood level; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; article; brain atrophy; brain size; dementia; diabetes mellitus; diagnosis related group; dysglycemia; female; glucose blood level; hemoglobin blood level; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; temporal lobe; vascular lesion; Alzheimer disease; atrophy; brain; Cerebrovascular Disorders; complication; Glucose Metabolism Disorders; metabolism; mild cognitive impairment; organ size; pathology; vascularization; very elderly","L.G.

The aim of this study was to longitudinally evaluate an index based on morphometric measures derived from MRI data that could be used for classification of AD and healthy control subjects, as well as prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Patients originated from the AddNeuroMed project at baseline (119 AD, 119 MCI, 110 controls (CTL)) and 1-year follow-up (62 AD, 73 MCI, 79 CTL). Data consisted of 3D T1-weighted MR images, demographics, MMSE, ADAS-Cog, CERAD and CDR scores, and APOE e4 status. We computed an index using a multivariate classification model (AD vs. CTL), using orthogonal partial least squares to latent structures (OPLS). Sensitivity, specificity and AUC were determined. Performance of the classifier (AD vs. CTL) was high at baseline (10-fold cross-validation, 84% sensitivity, 91% specificity, 0.93 AUC) and at 1-year follow-up (92% sensitivity, 74% specificity, 0.93 AUC). Predictions of conversion from MCI to AD were good at baseline (77% of MCI converters) and at follow-up (91% of MCI converters). MCI carriers of the APOE e4 allele manifested more atrophy and presented a faster cognitive decline when compared to non-carriers. The derived index demonstrated a steady increase in atrophy over time, yielding higher accuracy in prediction at the time of clinical conversion. Neuropsychological tests appeared less sensitive to changes over time. However, taking the average of the two time points yielded better correlation between the index and cognitive scores as opposed to using cross-sectional data only. Thus, multivariate classification seemed to detect patterns of AD changes before conversion from MCI to AD and including longitudinal information is of great importance. © 2014 Aguilar, Muehlboeck, Mecocci, Vellas, Tsolaki, Kloszewska, Soininen, Lovestone, Wahlund, Simmons and Westman.

DESIGN: Population based cohort study of individuals aged ≥65. SETTING: The Dijon magnetic resonance imaging study cohort from the Three-City Study, France. PARTICIPANTS: 1721 people without dementia who underwent an MRI scan at baseline and with known dementia status over 10 years' follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident dementia (all cause and Alzheimer's disease). RESULTS: During 10 years of follow-up, there were 119 confirmed cases of dementia, 84 of which were Alzheimer's disease. The conventional risk model incorporated age, sex, education, cognition, physical function, lifestyle (smoking, alcohol use), health (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, systolic blood pressure), and the apolipoprotein genotype (C statistic for discrimination performance was 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.82). No significant differences were observed in the discrimination performance of the conventional risk model compared with models incorporating data from MRI including white matter lesion volume (C statistic 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 0.82; P=0.48 for difference of C statistics), brain volume (0.77, 0.72 to 0.82; P=0.60), hippocampal volume (0.79, 0.74 to 0.84; P=0.07), or all three variables combined (0.79, 0.75 to 0.84; P=0.05). Inclusion of hippocampal volume or all three MRI variables combined in the conventional model did, however, lead to significant improvement in reclassification measured by using the integrated discrimination improvement index (P=0.03 and P=0.04) and showed increased net benefit in decision curve analysis. Similar results were observed when the outcome was restricted to Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Data from MRI do not significantly improve discrimination performance in prediction of all cause dementia beyond a model incorporating demographic, cognitive, health, lifestyle, physical function, and genetic data. There were, however, statistical improvements in reclassification, prognostic separation, and some evidence of clinical utility. © BMJ Publishing Group Ltd 2015.","","Aged; Comorbidity; Dementia; Disease Progression; Follow-Up Studies; France; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Predictive Value of Tests; Prevalence; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; apolipoprotein E4; age; aged; alcohol consumption; allele; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain size; cardiovascular disease; cognition; cohort analysis; controlled study; decision making; dementia; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; disease classification; education; female; follow up; functional assessment; genetic risk; genotype; health; health statistics; health status; hippocampal volume; human; Lawton and Brody scale; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; Mini Mental State Examination; multivariate analysis; neurologic examination; neuropsychology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; outcome assessment; physical activity; population research; priority journal; prognosis; proportional hazards model; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; sex; smoking; systolic blood pressure; white matter lesion; clinical trial; comorbidity; dementia; disease course; France; multicenter study; neuropsychological test; pathology; pathophysiology; predictive value; prevalence; prospective study; reproducibility","","","BMJ Publishing Group","09598146","","BMJOA","26099688","English","BMJ (Online)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939223770"

In schizophrenia (SZ), ECT is frequently considered in drug-resistant cases, as an augmentation of antipsychotic treatment or in cases when rapid symptom relief is indicated. Accumulating neuroimaging evidence suggests modulation of medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortical regions in MDD by ECT. In SZ, ECT-effects on brain structure have not been systematically investigated so far. In this study, we investigated brain volume in 21 ECT-naïve patients (12 with MDD, 9 with SZ) who received right-sided unilateral ECT. Twenty-one healthy controls were included. Structural magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired before and after ECT. Healthy participants were scanned once. Source-based morphometry was used to investigate modulation of structural networks pre/post ECT. ECT had an impact on distinct structural networks in MDD and SZ. In both MDD and SZ SBM revealed a medial temporal lobe (MTL) network (including hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex) which showed a significant increase after ECT. The increase in MTL network strength was not associated with clinical improvement in either MDD or SZ. In SZ a lateral prefrontal/cingulate cortical network showed a volume increase after ECT, and this effect was accompanied by clinical improvement. These findings provide preliminary evidence for structural network change in response to ECT in MDD and SZ. The data suggest both diagnosis-specific and transdiagnostic ECT-effects on brain volume. In contrast to SZ, in MDD structural network modulation by ECT was not associated with clinical improvement. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP","Depression; ECT; Electroconvulsive therapy; Prefrontal cortex; Schizophrenia; Source-based morphometry","Adult; Brain; Depressive Disorder, Major; Electroconvulsive Therapy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Pathways; Neuronal Plasticity; Organ Size; Schizophrenia; Treatment Outcome; adult; brain; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; electroconvulsive therapy; female; follow up; human; major depression; male; middle aged; nerve cell plasticity; nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; schizophrenia; treatment outcome","R.C.

The dynamic of these alterations was examined in the AD preclinical phase using data from the 10-year follow-up of a population-based cohort (Bordeaux-3City). Methods Participants received neuropsychological assessments every 2 years and two identical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams at baseline and 4 years later. Twenty-five incident AD cases were compared with 319 subjects who remained free of dementia. Subjects were free of dementia at baseline and at follow-up MRI. Incident AD occurred after these time points. Results At baseline, incident AD already presented smaller volumes only in the left amygdalo-hippocampal complex. Moreover, a higher annual rate of atrophy of the temporoparietal cortices was observed in future AD subjects during the following 4 years. Conclusion Incident AD cases present mediotemporal lesions up to 5 years before diagnosis. This neurodegenerative process seems to progressively reach the temporoparietal cortices in the AD preclinical phase. © 2014 The Alzheimers Association.

However, recent advances in machine learning, specifically the iterative sure independence screening (SIS) method, have enabled the analysis of datasets where the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations. Using an implementation of the SIS algorithm (called EPISIS), we used exhaustive search of the genome-wide, SNP-SNP interactome to identify and prioritize SNPs for interaction analysis. We identified a significant SNP pair, rs1345203 and rs1213205, associated with temporal lobe volume. We further examined the full-brain, voxelwise effects of the interaction in the ADNI dataset and separately in an independent dataset of healthy twins (QTIM). We found that each additional loading in the epistatic effect was associated with ∼5% greater brain regional brain volume (a protective effect) in both the ADNI and QTIM samples. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","epistasis; genome; interaction; sure independence; tensor-based morphometry","Algorithms; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Chromosome Mapping; Cohort Studies; Connectome; Epistasis, Genetic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Organ Size; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genes; Iterative methods; Neuroimaging; Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Genes; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Neuroimaging; epistasis; Epistatic effects; interaction; Interaction analysis; Neuroimaging genetics; Protective effects; sure independence; Tensor-based morphometry; Epistasis; Epistatic effects; Interaction; Interaction analysis; Neuroimaging genetics; Protective effects; Sure independence; Tensor-based morphometry; algorithm; Alzheimer disease; article; brain; chromosome map; cohort analysis; connectome; epistasis; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; single nucleotide polymorphism; Loading; Medical computing","","","","16113349","978-364240759-8","","24505811","English","Lect.

OBJECTIVES To confirm previous findings related to IQ-based subgroups of patients with schizophrenia in an independent sample and extend those findings to determine the extent to which brain volumetric differences correspond to the IQ-based subgroups. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 183 participantswere assessed at the outpatient settings of Neuroscience Research Australia and Lyell McEwin Hospital from September 22, 2009, to August 1, 2012. Patients were classified using cluster analysis on the basis of current and premorbid IQ differences. Regional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain volumes were compared among the IQ-based subgroups using analysis of covariance with intracranial volume and age as covariates. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, third edition, scores; Wechsler Test of Adult Reading scores; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores; and MRI brain volumes. RESULTS Ninety-six outpatients (mean [SD] age, 35.7 [8.4] years; age range, 18-51 years; 59 men) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 87 healthy controls (mean [SD] age, 31.9 [8.4] years; age range, 20-50 years; 46 men) were studied. Sixty-two patients and 67 healthy controls underwent structural MRI of the brain. Cluster analyses revealed 25 putatively preserved patients (26%), 33 moderately deteriorated patients (34%), 27 severely deteriorated patients (28%), and 11 compromised patients (12%). Negative symptom scores were significantly worse in the severely deteriorated group relative to the putatively preserved group (F2,82 = 13.8, P < .001, effect size [ES] = 1.40). Patient subgroups analyzed revealed significantly reduced inferior parietal volume relative to controls (F3,113 = 9.7, P < .001, ES = 0.85-1.24). The severely deteriorated group had significantly reduced total hippocampal (mean [SEM], 8309.6 [175.0] vs 9024.0 [145.5]; P = .01), lingual gyrus (mean [SEM], 11 996.0 [531.5] vs 13 838.1 [441.9]; P = .05), and superior temporal sulcus (mean [SEM], 4697.8 [192.0] vs 5446.0 [159.6]; P = .05) gray matter volumes relative to the putatively preserved group (ES = 0.91-1.10). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Using an independent sample, we obtained proportions in each IQ-based subgroup that were similar to our previous work. Inferior parietal volume reduction was characteristic of schizophrenia relative to controls, and the severely deteriorated IQ group had widespread volumetric reductions. Classifying cognitive heterogeneity in schizophrenia provides a platform to better characterize the neurobiological underpinnings of the illness and its treatment. © 2016 American Medical Association.

But only a few studies have explored the possibility of AD detection from non-image data. These studies have applied traditional data visualization and classification algorithms. There is a need for new sophisticated learning algorithms, for detecting and quantifying the severity of AD by exploring the complex interactions between the features in AD subjects. Method: In this work, a supervised learning model to effectively capture the complex feature interactions, in the sample space of AD data, is presented for knowledge discovery. The discovered knowledge is further used to quantify the similarity of a test subject to the demented class. Results: Evaluation of the proposed model, on OASIS database of Alzheimer's subjects, validates the well established risk factors and identifiers for AD: Age, Socio-Economic Status, MMSE Score and Whole Brain Volume. The Test subjects are affiliated to either non-demented (ND) or AD class, with non-overlapping and measurable similarity indices: Female ND (CDR=0) [0.48–2.90], Female AD (CDR=0.5) [90.16–774.51], Female AD (CDR=1) [1633.90–7182.23], Female AD (CDR=2) [55258.51–66382.44], Male ND (CDR=0)[0.69–3.66], Male AD (CDR=0.5) [99.18–647.51] and Male AD (CDR=1) [3880.16–6519.40]. Conclusion: The outcome of the work clearly demonstrates that, supervised learning model can be used effectively to quantify the severity of AD on a standard measurable scale. This scale of distance can be used as a supplement for clinical dementia rating. © 2017","Affiliation analysis; Alzheimer's disease; Dementia; Knowledge discovery; Multifactor dimensionality reduction; Similarity measure","","C.R.

However, little is known about the relationship between global or regional brain volumes and cognitive test performance in American Indians. Materials and Methods: American Indian participants (N=698; median age, 72 y) recruited for the Cerebrovascular Disease and its Consequences in American Indians study, an ancillary study of the Strong Heart Study cohort, were enrolled. Linear regression models assessed the relationship between magnetic resonance imaging brain volumes (total brain and hippocampi) and cognitive measures of verbal learning and recall, processing speed, verbal fluency, and global cognition. Results: After controlling for demographic and clinical factors, all volumetric measurements were positively associated with processing speed. Total brain volume was also positively associated with verbal learning, but not with verbal recall. Conversely, left hippocampal volume was associated with both verbal learning and recall. The relationship between hippocampal volume and recall performance was more pronounced among those with lower scores on a global cognitive measure. Controlling for APOE ϵ4 did not substantively affect the associations. Conclusions: These results support further investigation into the relationship between structural Alzheimer disease biomarkers, cognition, genetics, and vascular risk factors in aging American Indians. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

A set of 30 brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes for each group was segmented and two indices were measured for several structures: three-dimensional DC and normalized volumes (NVs). The discrimination power of these indices was determined by means of the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic, where the proposed compactness index showed an average AUC of 0.7 for HC versus MCI comparison, 0.9 for HC versus AD separation, and 0.75 for MCI versus AD groups. In all cases, this index outperformed the discrimination capability of the NV. Using selected features from the set of DC and NV measures, three support vector machines were optimized and validated for the pairwise separation of the three classes. Our analysis shows classification rates of up to 98.3% between HC and AD, 85% between HC and MCI, and 93.3% for MCI and AD separation. These results outperform those reported in the literature and demonstrate the viability of the proposed morphological indices to classify different aging stages. © The Authors.

However, the current diagnosis highly depends on the knowledge and experience of clinicians and hence subjective in nature. Thus, the focus of this study is to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) method using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate PD from controls. Method: The proposed method utilizes graph-theory-based spectral feature selection method to select a set of discriminating features from whole brain volume. A decision model is built using support vector machine as a classifier with leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. The performance measures, namely, sensitivity, specificity, and classification accuracy, are utilized to evaluate the performance of the decision model. The efficacy of the proposed method is checked on volumetric 3D T1-weighted (1 mm iso-voxel) MRI dataset of 30 PD patients and 30 age and gender matched controls acquired with 1.5T MRI scanner. Results: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to differentiate PD from controls with an accuracy of 86.67%, which encourages the use of CAD. The performance of the proposed method outperforms the existing methods except one. In addition, it is observed that the maximum number of selected features belong to caudate region followed by cuneus region. Thus, these regions may be considered as potential biomarkers in diagnosis of PD. Conclusion The proposed method may be utilized by the clinicians for diagnosis of PD. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Irrespective of diagnosis and intervention, associations between brain changes and cardiorespiratory fitness improvement were examined. Sixty-three schizophrenia patients and fifty-five healthy controls participated in this randomised controlled trial. Global brain volumes, hippocampal volume, and cortical thickness were estimated from 3-Tesla MRI scans. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed with a cardiopulmonary ergometer test. Subjects were assigned exercise therapy or occupational therapy (patients) and exercise therapy or life-as-usual (healthy controls) for six months 2. h weekly. Exercise therapy effects were analysed for subjects who were compliant at least 50% of sessions offered. Significantly smaller baseline cerebral (grey) matter, and larger third ventricle volumes, and thinner cortex in most areas of the brain were found in patients versus controls. Exercise therapy did not affect global brain and hippocampal volume or cortical thickness in patients and controls. Cardiorespiratory fitness improvement was related to increased cerebral matter volume and lateral and third ventricle volume decrease in patients and to thickening in the left hemisphere in large areas of the frontal, temporal and cingulate cortex irrespective of diagnosis. One to 2. h of exercise therapy did not elicit significant brain volume changes in patients or controls. However, cardiorespiratory fitness improvement attenuated brain volume changes in schizophrenia patients and increased thickness in large areas of the left cortex in both schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.","Brain volume; Cardiorespiratory fitness; Cortical thickness; Exercise therapy; MRI; Schizophrenia","Adolescent; Adult; Antipsychotic Agents; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Cerebral Cortex; Exercise Test; Exercise Therapy; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Occupational Therapy; Physical Fitness; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Schizophrenia; adult; article; brain cortex; brain size; brain third ventricle; cardiorespiratory fitness; cingulate gyrus; clinical assessment; controlled study; ergometer; female; fitness; frontal cortex; gray matter; hemisphere; hippocampus; human; kinesiotherapy; major clinical study; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occupational therapy; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; schizophrenia; temporal cortex; thickness; treatment duration","T.W.

Methods: Three groups were enrolled, including 28 normal control (NC), 36 cases in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group, 29 cases in AD group and 28 healthy olders in normal control (NC) group. Three dimensional MRI structural data was obtained. The relative quantity volume of brain regions were calculated through the online software. The MRI data were transfered to the inline software. And volume of each brain area were normalized to an index number of percentage using the whole brain volume. Brain areas with statistical volumetric differences were obtained with one-way ANOVA and non-parametric rank sum test. The diagnosis efficacy of different brain regions was evaluated with ROC curve and support vector machine (SVM) among three groups. Results: The volume of bilateral hippocampus, left and right cingulated cortex, insula, bilateral frontal, bilateral temporal, and bilateral parietal lobe showed significant differences among NC, MCI and AD groups (P<0.001). And the difference were also found between AD group and MCI group, AD group and NC group. ROC analysis showed that the highest the highest area under the curve (AUC) value between AD group and NC group, MCI group and NC group, AD group and MCI group, AD+MCI groups and NC group were observed in the left temporal lobe (0.95), left insula (0.69), right cingulated lobe (0.85) and left temporal lobe (0.80). SVM analysis showed that the highest classification accuracy rates between AD group and NC group, MCI group and NC group, AD group and MCI group, AD+MCI groups and NC group were observed in bilateral hippocampus (89.09%), left insula (64.52%), right hippocampus (77.78%) and left hippocampus (71.11%), respectively. Accuracy rate as high as 94.55% was obtained with combination analysis between AD group and NC group. Conclusion: The individual-level inline morphometry analysis is consistent with the Alzheimer pathology, and the software can be applied in the clinics.

AD subjects included in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study were classified into subtypes based on standardized values (Z-scores) of hippocampal and regional cortical volumes on MRI with reference to age- And gender-specific norms obtained from 222 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. Baseline and longitudinal changes of clinical characteristics over 2 years were compared across subtypes. Wholebrain- level gray matter (GM) atrophy pattern using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of the subtypes were also investigated. Of 163 AD subjects, 58.9% were classified as the ""both impaired"" subtype with the typical hippocampal and cortical atrophy pattern, whereas 41.1% were classified as the subtypes with atypical atrophy patterns: ""hippocampal atrophy only"" (19.0%), ""cortical atrophy only"" (11.7%), and ""both spared"" (10.4%). Voxel-based morphometric analysis demonstrated whole-brainlevel differences in overall GM atrophy across the subtypes. These subtypes showed different progression rates over 2 years; and all subtypes had significantly lower CSF amyloid- β1-42 levels compared to CN. In conclusion, we identified four AD subtypes exhibiting heterogeneous atrophy patterns on MRI with different progression rates after controlling the effects of aging and gender on atrophy with normative information. CSF biomarker analysis suggests the presence of Aβ neuropathology irrespective of subtypes. Such heterogeneity of MRI-based neuronal injury biomarker and related heterogeneous progression patterns should be considered in clinical trials and practice with AD patients. © 2015 Byun et al.

Urate-related compounds are therapeutic candidates in neuroprotective efforts to slow PD progression. A urate-elevating agent is currently under investigation as a potential disease-modifying strategy in people with PD. However, PD is a heterogeneous disorder, and genetic variation may explain divergence in disease severity and progression. Methods We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify gene variant × serum urate interaction effects on the striatal 123I-ioflupane (DaTscan) binding ratio measured using single photon emission computed tomography in patients with possible PD from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI, n = 360). Follow-up analyses were conducted to assess gene variant × serum urate interaction effects on magnetic resonance imaging-derived regional brain volumes and clinical status. We then attempted to replicate our primary analysis in patients who entered the Parkinson Research Examination of CEP-1347 Trial (PRECEPT) with a clinical diagnosis of PD (n = 349). Results Rs1109303 (T>G) variant within the INPP5K gene on chromosome 17p13.3 demonstrated a genome-wide significant interaction with serum urate level to predict striatal dopamine transporter density among all PPMI participants (n = 359) with possible PD (p = 2.01 × 10-8; after excluding participants with SWEDD [scan without evidence of dopaminergic deficit]: p = 1.12 × 10-9; n = 316). Independent of striatal dopamine transporter density, similar effects on brain atrophy, bradykinesia, anxiety, and depression were observed. No effect was present in the PRECEPT sample at baseline; however, in non-SWEDD PD participants in PRECEPT (n = 309), we observed a significant longitudinal genotype × serum urate interaction effect, consistent in direction with the PPMI sample, on progression of striatal dopamine transporter density over the 22-month follow-up. Interpretation Genetic profile combined with serum urate level can be used to predict disease severity and potential disease progression in patients with PD. These results may be relevant to therapeutic efforts targeting the urate pathway. © 2015 American Neurological Association.","","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Behavior; Corpus Striatum; Disease Progression; Dopamine; Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Nortropanes; Parkinson Disease; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Predictive Value of Tests; Radiopharmaceuticals; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; Uric Acid; 9,12 epoxy 5,16 bis[(ethylthio)methyl] 2,3,9,10,11,12 hexahydro 10 hydroxy 9 methyl 1 oxo 1h diindolo[1,2,3 fg:3',2',1' kl]pyrrolo[3,4 i][1,6]benzodiazocine 10 carboxylic acid methyl ester; dopamine transporter; ioflupane i 123; urate; dopamine; dopamine transporter; inositol-polyphosphate 5-phosphatase; ioflupane; nortropane derivative; phosphatase; radiopharmaceutical agent; uric acid; adult; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; bradykinesia; brain atrophy; brain size; chromosome 17p; controlled study; depression; disease course; disease duration; disease severity; female; follow up; gene; genetic association; genetic variability; genotype; human; INPP5K gene; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observational study; Parkinson disease; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; single photon emission computer tomography; uric acid blood level; voxel based morphometry; behavior; blood; corpus striatum; deficiency; genetic association; genetics; metabolism; middle aged; Parkinson disease; predictive value; scintiscanning; very elderly","","","John Wiley and Sons Inc.","03645134","","ANNED","26284320","English","Ann.

Objective: To compare the changes of metabolites between AD and MCI in specific locations of the brain by using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). Material and Method: MMSE-Thai 2002 and neuropsychological test were performed in 17 patients with memory problem, classified into AD and MCI (10, 7 patients respectively). All patients and three age-matched cognitively normal volunteers were examined with conventional MRI and MRS of the brain. Volumes of interest were located at both-sided frontal and parietal deep white matter. NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, and mI/Cr ratios of the patients were analyzed and statistically evaluated relative to cognitively normal volunteers. Statistical analysis was performed using Cohen's kappa coefficient and Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: There was no statistically significant change in metabolites in all brain regions. For AD relative to cognitively normal volunteers, there were strong tendency toward statistically significant decreased NAA/Cr at the left frontal and left parietal regions (p = 0.043 each) and decreased Cho/Cr at the left frontal region (p = 0.028). Conclusion: The changes of the metabolite ratios of MCI were much closer to AD. Strong tendency toward statistically significant decreased NAA/Cr in the left cerebral hemisphere, predominantly parietal region and strong tendency toward statistically significant decreased Cho/Cr at the left frontal region were indicative of neurodegeneration and replacement by gliosis. MRS may be useful for predict a chance that cognitively normal people may convert to the AD.","Alzheimer's disease; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Mild cognitive impairment","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Aspartic Acid; Case-Control Studies; Choline; Creatine; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Inositol; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Mild Cognitive Impairment; choline; creatine; creatine phosphate; inositol; n acetylaspartic acid; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; article; clinical article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease classification; female; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; male; memory disorder; metabolite; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; retrospective study","W.

The aim of this study was to investigate possible cortical thickness correlations in frontotemporal regions in relation to age at onset and duration of illness. Methods One hundred forty-eight schizophrenia patients (97 males; age and SD 36.30 ± 10.06) and 87 (57 males; age and SD 36.48 ± 10.10) age-matched healthy subjects underwent a brain MRI scan. Cortical segmentation and surface statistical analysis were performed using the FreeSurfer software package. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Monte Carlo method considering a cluster-corrected Type I Error of 5%. Results Compared to controls, schizophrenia patients presented significant cortical thinning in the frontotemporal, parietal, and occipital cortices. No correlation between prefrontal cortex thickness and duration of illness in patients with schizophrenia or between frontotemporal cortical thickness and age at onset was found. However, a significant interaction between age and diagnosis was observed on frontal cortical thickness with patients presenting a thinner cortex than expected for age. Conclusion Although there was no correlation between age of onset and duration of illness with brain volume, our findings suggest that there is an accelerated cortical loss in schizophrenia, thus reinforcing the progressive processes of the disease.

Vascular pathology, Lewy bodies, TDP-43, and hippocampal sclerosis are frequent comorbidities. There is therefore a need for biomarkers that can assess these etiologies and provide a diagnosis in vivo.; OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review of published radiological-pathological correlation studies to determine the relationship between antemortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropathological findings in AD.; METHODS: We explored PubMed in June-July 2015 using ""Alzheimer's disease"" and combinations of radiological and pathological terms. After exclusion following screening and full-text assessment of the 552 extracted manuscripts, three others were added from their reference list. In the end, we report results based on 27 articles.; RESULTS: Independently of normal age-related brain atrophy, AD pathology is associated with whole-brain and hippocampal atrophy and ventricular expansion as observed on T1-weighted images. Moreover, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cortical microinfarcts are also related to brain volume loss in AD. Hippocampal sclerosis and TDP-43 are associated with hippocampal and medial temporal lobe atrophy, respectively. Brain volume loss correlates more strongly with tangles than with any other pathological finding. White matter hyperintensities observed on proton density, T2-weighted and FLAIR images are strongly related to vascular pathologies, but are also associated with other histological changes such as gliosis or demyelination.; CONCLUSION: Cerebral atrophy and white matter changes in the living brain reflect underlying neuropathology and may be detectable using antemortem MRI. In vivo MRI may therefore be an avenue for AD pathological staging.","Alzheimer’s disease; antemortem diagnosis; dementia; magnetic resonance imaging; neuroimaging; neuropathology","Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer disease; brain; diagnostic imaging; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology","","","","18758908","","","28282807","English","J.

Predicting conversion is clinically important as because novel drugs currently being developed require administration early in the disease process to be effective. Traditionally training data are labelled with discrete disease states; which may explain the limited accuracies obtained as labels are noisy due to the difficulty in providing a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer’s without post-mortem confirmation, and ignore the existence of a continuous spectrum of disease severity. Here, we dispense with discrete training labels and instead predict the loss of brain volume over one year, a quantity that can be repeatably and objectively measured with the boundary shift integral and is strongly correlated with conversion. The method combines MRI and PET image data and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels in an Bayesian multi-kernel learning framework. The resulting predicted atrophy separates converting and non-converting MCI subjects with 74.6% accuracy, which compares well to state of the art methods despite a small training set size. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Atrophy; BSI; Gaussian processes; Mild cognitive impairment; MRI; Multi-kernel learning; PET Alzheimer’s disease; Regression","Artificial intelligence; Cerebrospinal fluid; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neuroimaging; Alzheimer; Atrophy; Gaussian Processes; Mild cognitive impairments; Multi-kernel learning; Regression; Diagnosis","J.

It proposes that abnormal production of beta amyloid protein (Abeta) is the cause of AD and that the neurotoxicity is due to Abeta itself or its oligomeric forms. We suggest that this, in itself, cannot be the cause of AD because demonstrating such toxicity requires micromolar concentrations of these Abeta forms, while their levels in brain are a million times lower in the picomolar range. AD probably results from the inflammatory response induced by extracellular Abeta deposits, which later become enhanced by aggregates of tau. The inflammatory response, which is driven by activated microglia, increases over time as the disease progresses. Disease-modifying therapeutic attempts to date have failed and may continue to do so as long as the central role of inflammation is not taken into account. Multiple epidemiological and animal model studies show that NSAIDs, the most widely used antiinflammatory agents, have a substantial sparing effect on AD. These studies provide a proof of concept regarding the anti-inflammatory approach to disease modification. Biomarker studies have indicated that early intervention may be necessary. They have established that disease onset occurs more than a decade before it becomes clinically evident. By combining biomarker and pathological data, it is possible to define six phases of disease development, each separated by about 5 years. Phase one can be identified by decreases in Abeta in the CSF, phase 2 by increases of tau in the CSF plus clear evidence of Abeta brain deposits by PET scanning, phase 3 by slight decreases in brain metabolic rate by PET-FDG scanning, phase 4 by slight decreases in brain volume by MRI scanning plus minimal cognitive impairment, phase 5 by increased scanning abnormalities plus clinical diagnosis of AD, and phase 6 by advanced AD requiring institutional care. Utilization of antiinflammatory agents early in the disease process remains an overlooked therapeutic opportunity. Such agents, while not preventative, have the advantage of being able to inhibit the consequences of both Abeta and tau aggregation. Since there is more than a decade between disease onset and cognitive decline, a window of opportunity exists to introduce truly effective disease-modifying regimens. Taking advantage of this opportunity is the challenge for the future. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biomarkers; Complement; CSF; Microglia; NSAIDs; Positron emission tomography; Tau","Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer Vaccines; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Antioxidants; Biological Markers; Diet; Humans; Immunization; Inflammation; Mutation; Peptide Fragments; Translational Medical Research; Alzheimer disease vaccine; amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta protein[1-40]; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; amyloid beta protein[25-35]; amyloid precursor protein; apolipoprotein E4; avagacestat; bapineuzumab; beta secretase inhibitor; binding protein; biological marker; complement component C3b receptor; crenezumab; fluorodeoxyglucose; homotaurine; indometacin; ly 2886721; membrane receptor; mk 8931; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly binding protein; placebo; ponezumab; semagacestat; solanezumab; tarenflurbil; tau protein; triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; active immunization; Alzheimer disease; binding affinity; brain size; cerebrospinal fluid; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial (topic); cognitive defect; dietary intake; DNA polymorphism; drug efficacy; drug fatality; drug protein binding; drug safety; early intervention; edema; encephalitis; gene mutation; genetic risk; history of medicine; human; immunosuppressive treatment; liver examination; meningoencephalitis; microglia; nervous system inflammation; neuropathology; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; onset age; passive immunization; positron emission tomography; priority journal; protein aggregation; protein cleavage; review; side effect; skin cancer; skin infection; transgenic animal; treatment failure","P.L.

Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Charlestown, MA, United States","Several but not all MRI studies have reported volume reductions in the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in patients with schizophrenia. Given the high prevalence of smoking among schizophrenia patients and the fact that smoking has also been associated with alterations in brain morphology, this study evaluated whether a proportion of the known gray matter reductions in key brain regions may be attributed to smoking rather than to schizophrenia alone.We examined structural MRI data of 112 schizophrenia patients (53 smokers and 59 non-smokers) and 77 healthy non-smoker controls collected by the MCIC study of schizophrenia. An automated atlas based probabilistic method was used to generate volumetric measures of the hippocampus and DLPFC. The two patient groups were matched with respect to demographic and clinical variables.Smoker schizophrenia patients showed significantly lower hippocampal and DLPFC volumes than non-smoker schizophrenia patients. Gray matter volume reductions associated with smoking status ranged between 2.2% and 2.8%. Furthermore, we found significant volume differences between smoker patients and healthy controls in the hippocampus and DLPFC, but not between non-smoker patients and healthy controls.Our data suggest that a proportion of the volume reduction seen in the hippocampus and DLPFC in schizophrenia is associated with smoking rather than with the diagnosis of schizophrenia. These results may have important implications for brain imaging studies comparing schizophrenia patients and other groups with a lower smoking prevalence. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Brain volume; DLPFC; Hippocampus; MRI; Schizophrenia; Smoking","Adult; Brain; Cerebral Cortex; Confounding Factors (Epidemiology); Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nerve Fibers, Unmyelinated; Organ Size; Prefrontal Cortex; Schizophrenia; Smoking; Brain volume; DLPFC; Hippocampus; MRI; Schizophrenia; Smoking; neuroleptic agent; adult; article; brain region; brain size; cognition; confounding variable; controlled study; female; gray matter; hippocampus; human; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; schizophrenia; smoking","S.

However, very little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying these differences. Here, we compared morphometric abnormalities between patients with EOS and those with LOS. A total of 22 patients with LOS, 24 patients with EOS and 41 healthy control subjects were included in this magnetic resonance imaging study. Brain images were analyzed using DARTEL preprocessing for voxel-based morphometry in SPM8. We tested a main effect of diagnosis in the whole-brain analysis and compared the results among the three groups. We also carried out correlation analyses between regional volumes and clinical variables. Patients with LOS showed larger gray matter (GM) volume of the left precuneus compared with healthy subjects and patients with EOS. Patients with LOS and EOS showed decreased GM volumes in the right insula, left superior temporal gyrus and left orbitofrontal gyrus compared with healthy subjects. A longer duration of illness was associated with reduced GM volume in the temporal pole in patients with EOS. Our findings may help improve our understanding of schizophrenia pathophysiology and shed light on the different and shared neurobiological underpinnings of LOS and EOS. © 2014 S.

MRI protocols included three dimensional brain structural imaging and diffusion tensor imaging to assess the cortical thickness, subcortical volume and white matter integrity. Recursive feature elimination based on support vector machine (SVM) was conducted to determine the most relevant features for classifying abnormal regions and imaging parameters, and then a factor analysis for the top-ranked factors was performed. Subjects were classified using nonlinear SVM.; Results Medial temporal regions in AD patients were dominantly detected with cortical thinning and volume atrophy compared with SMI and MCI patients. Damage to white matter integrity was also accredited with decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity (MD) across the three groups. The microscopic damage in the subcortical gray matter was reflected in increased MD. Classification accuracy between pairs of groups (SMI vs. MCI, MCI vs. AD, SMI vs. AD) and among all three groups were 84.4% (±13.8), 86.9% (±10.5), 96.3% (±4.6), and 70.5% (±11.5), respectively.; Conclusion This proposed method may be a potential tool to diagnose AD pathology with the current clinical criteria. © 2015 Korean Neuropsychiatric Association.","Alzheimer’s disease; Diagnosis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Support vector machines","aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; atrophy; cingulate gyrus; clinical feature; cognitive defect; controlled study; cortical thickness (brain); diffusion tensor imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; disease classification; disease course; female; fractional anisotropy; gray matter; hippocampus; human; image analysis; image processing; major clinical study; male; memory disorder; Mini Mental State Examination; nervous system parameters; neuropsychological test; subcortical volume; support vector machine; volumetry; white matter","","","Korean Neuropsychiatric Association","17383684","","","","English","Psychiatry Investig.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921962332"

In this study, multiple heterogeneous predictors of AD were combined using a supervised learning method called Disease State Index (DSI). The behavior of DSI values over time was examined to study disease progression quantitatively in a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cohort. The DSI method was applied to longitudinal data from 140 MCI cases that progressed to AD and 149 MCI cases that did not progress to AD during the follow-up. The data included neuropsychological tests, brain volumes from magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid samples, and apolipoprotein E from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Linear regression of the longitudinal DSI values (including the DSI value at the point of MCI to AD conversion) was performed for each subject having at least three DSI values available (147 non-converters, 126 converters). Converters had five times higher slopes and almost three times higher intercepts than non-converters. Two subgroups were found in the group of non-converters: one group with stable DSI values over time and another group with clearly increasing DSI values suggesting possible progression to AD in the future. The regression parameters differentiated between the converters and the non-converters with classification accuracy of 76.9% for the slopes and 74.6% for the intercepts. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that quantifying longitudinal patient data using the DSI method provides valid information for follow-up of disease progression and support for decision making.

However, traditional genetic association studies have not found a clear relationship between BDNF and AD. Our goal was to test whether BDNF single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) impact Alzheimer's Disease-related brain imaging and cognitive markers of disease. We completed an imaging genetics study on 645 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants (ND=175, MCI=316, AD=154) who had cognitive, brain imaging, and genetics data at baseline and a subset of those with brain imaging data at two years. Samples were genotyped using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip. 13 SNPs in BDNF were identified in the dataset following quality control measures (rs6265(Val66Met), rs12273363, rs11030094, rs925946, rs1050187, rs2203877, rs11030104, rs11030108, rs10835211, rs7934165, rs908867, rs1491850, rs1157459). We analyzed a subgroup of 8 SNPs that were in low linkage disequilibrium with each other. Automated brain morphometric measures were available through ADNI investigators, and we analyzed baseline cognitive scores, hippocampal and whole brain volumes, and rates of hippocampal and whole brain atrophy and rates of change in the ADAS-Cog over one and two years. Three out of eight BDNF SNPs analyzed were significantly associated with measures of cognitive decline (rs1157659, rs11030094, rs11030108). No SNPs were significantly associated with baseline brain volume measures, however six SNPs were significantly associated with hippocampal and/or whole brain atrophy over two years (rs908867, rs11030094, rs6265, rs10501087, rs1157659, rs1491850). We also found an interaction between the BDNF Val66Met SNP and age with whole brain volume. Our imaging-genetics analysis in a large dataset suggests that while BDNF genetic variation is not specifically associated with a diagnosis of AD, it appears to play a role in AD-related brain neurodegeneration. © 2013 Honea et al.","","Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Cognition; Female; Genotype; Humans; Linkage Disequilibrium; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Organ Size; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; brain derived neurotrophic factor; methionine; valine; aged; Alzheimer disease; Alzheimer disease assessment scale cognitive subscale; article; Bdnf gene; brain atrophy; brain size; cognition; controlled study; female; gene; gene function; gene interaction; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic analysis; genetic association; genetic variability; genetics; genotype; hippocampus; human; major clinical study; male; morphometrics; nerve degeneration; neuroimaging; pathogenesis; phenotype; quality control; scoring system; single nucleotide polymorphism","R.

Moreover, the early detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) has recently attracted a lot of attention. The main objective of this paper is to present a survey of recent key papers focused on the classification of MCI and AD and the prediction of conversion from MCI to AD using volume, shape and texture analysis. The most frequent anatomical features used in the assessment of AD, is the hippocampus, the cortex and the local concentration of grey matter. Shape analysis can identify the signs of early hippocampal atrophy, whereas volume analysis evaluates the structure as a whole. Shape analysis seems to be a more accurate technique both in classification of patients and in prognostic prediction. Compared to volume, shape and voxel based morphometry (VBM) techniques, texture analysis can be used to identify the microstructural changes before the larger-scale morphological characteristics which are detected by the other aforementioned techniques. We concluded that quantitative MRI measurements can be used as an in vivo surrogate for the classification of patients and furthermore, for the tracking the Alzheimer’s disease progression. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Alzheimer’s disease; Brain volume; Classification; Hippocampus; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Prediction; Quantitative MRI; Temporal lobe","Biochemical engineering; Brain; Classification (of information); Forecasting; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical computing; Medical imaging; Alzheimer; Brain volume; Hippocampus; Mild cognitive impairments; Quantitative mris; Temporal lobes; Diagnosis","S.

The risk of AD increases with age 65 and older although it may appear in people who are in their 40s or 50s. AD has no current cure. There are many ongoing research studies to understanding and treating this disease better. AD, a slowly progressive brain disease, begins well before clinical symptoms emerge. A diagnosis of AD is usually made by primary care physicians based on patient's medical and family history, psychiatric history, and history of cognitive and behavioral changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most common imaging modality to use to identify brain changes. In this study, MRI scans of 10 individuals without AD and 10 individuals with AD are compared and analyzed based on brain volume.

Methods: We applied a novel clustering tool with the goal to identify subpopulations of the AD patients that are homogeneous in respect of available clinical as well as in respect of biological descriptors. Results: The main result is identification of three clusters of patients with significant problems with dementia. The evaluation of properties of these clusters demonstrates that brain atrophy is the main driving force of dementia. The unexpected result is that the largest subpopulation that has very significant problems with dementia has besides mild signs of brain atrophy also large ventricular, intracerebral and whole brain volumes. Due to the fact that ventricular enlargement may be a consequence of brain injuries and that a large majority of patients in this subpopulation are males, a potential hypothesis is that such medical status is a consequence of a combination of previous traumatic events and degenerative processes. Conclusions: The results may have substantial consequences for medical research and clinical trial design. The clustering methodology used in this study may be interesting also for other medical and biological domains. © 2016 The Author(s).","Alzheimer's disease; Biomarker identification; Brain injuries; Clustering","Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Organ Size; Supervised Machine Learning; Biomarkers; Clinical research; Alzheimer's disease; Biomarker identification; Brain injury; Clinical trial designs; Clustering; Degenerative process; Homogeneous cluster; Patient population; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain atrophy; brain size; controlled study; disease association; disease classification; disease severity; executive function; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical research; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; Alzheimer disease; biology; brain; cluster analysis; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; procedures; supervised machine learning; Neurodegenerative diseases","D.

We enhanced the recently introduced event-based model for use with a multi-modal sporadic disease data set. This allows us to determine the sequence in which Alzheimer's disease biomarkers become abnormal without reliance on a priori clinical diagnostic information or explicit biomarker cut points. The model also characterizes the uncertainty in the ordering and provides a natural patient staging system. Two hundred and eighty-five subjects (92 cognitively normal, 129 mild cognitive impairment, 64 Alzheimer's disease) were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with measurements of 14 Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers including cerebrospinal fluid proteins, regional magnetic resonance imaging brain volume and rates of atrophy measures, and cognitive test scores. We used the event-based model to determine the sequence of biomarker abnormality and its uncertainty in various population subgroups. We used patient stages assigned by the event-based model to discriminate cognitively normal subjects from those with Alzheimer's disease, and predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment. The model predicts that cerebrospinal fluid levels become abnormal first, followed by rates of atrophy, then cognitive test scores, and finally regional brain volumes. In amyloid-positive (cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β1-42<192 pg/ml) or APOE-positive (one or more APOE4 alleles) subjects, the model predicts with high confidence that the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers become abnormal in a distinct sequence: amyloid-β1-42, phosphorylated tau, total tau. However, in the broader population total tau and phosphorylated tau are found to be earlier cerebrospinal fluid markers than amyloid-b1-42, albeit with more uncertainty. The model's staging system strongly separates cognitively normal and Alzheimer's disease subjects (maximum classification accuracy of 99%), and predicts conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (maximum balanced accuracy of 77% over 3 years), and from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (maximum balanced accuracy of 76% over 5 years). By fitting Cox proportional hazards models, we find that baseline model stage is a significant risk factor for conversion from both mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (P = 2.06 × 10-7) and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (P = 0.033). The data-driven model we describe supports hypothetical models of biomarker ordering in amyloid-positive and APOE-positive subjects, but suggests that biomarker ordering in the wider population may diverge from this sequence. The model provides useful disease staging information across the full spectrum of disease progression, from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. This approach has broad application across neurodegenerative disease, providing insights into disease biology, as well as staging and prognostication. © The Author (2014).","Alzheimer's disease; Biomarker ordering; Biomarkers; Disease progression; Event-based model","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apolipoproteins E; Biological Markers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Databases, Factual; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Models, Neurological; Neuropsychological Tests; Peptide Fragments; tau Proteins; Alzheimer's disease; biomarker ordering; biomarkers; disease progression; event-based model; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; apolipoprotein E4; biological marker; phosphorylated tau protein; tau protein; unclassified drug; Alzheimer disease; article; brain atrophy; brain size; cerebrospinal fluid level; chronosequence; cognition; computer assisted diagnosis; computer model; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; event based model; female; human; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; population research; predictive value; priority journal; prognosis; protein cerebrospinal fluid level; sporadic alzheimer disease; staging; uncertainty","A.L.

Analysis of brain texture from conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect disturbance in brain cytoarchitecture. We tested the hypothesis that patients with schizophrenia manifest quantitative differences in brain texture that, alongside discrete volumetric changes, may serve as an endophenotypic biomarker. Texture analysis (TA) of grey matter distribution and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of regional brain volumes were applied to MRI scans of 27 patients with schizophrenia and 24 controls. Texture parameters (uniformity and entropy) were also used as covariates in VBM analyses to test for correspondence with regional brain volume. Linear discriminant analysis tested if texture and volumetric data predicted diagnostic group membership (schizophrenia or control). We found that uniformity and entropy of grey matter differed significantly between individuals with schizophrenia and controls at the fine spatial scale (filter width below 2. mm). Within the schizophrenia group, these texture parameters correlated with volumes of the left hippocampus, right amygdala and cerebellum. The best predictor of diagnostic group membership was the combination of fine texture heterogeneity and left hippocampal size. This study highlights the presence of distributed grey-matter abnormalities in schizophrenia, and their relation to focal structural abnormality of the hippocampus. The conjunction of these features has potential as a neuroimaging endophenotype of schizophrenia. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Classifier; Endophenotype; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodevelopment; Psychosis","Adult; Amygdala; Brain; Cerebellum; Diagnosis, Differential; Endophenotypes; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Organ Size; Predictive Value of Tests; Research Design; Schizophrenia; Temporal Lobe; Young Adult; Classifier; Endophenotype; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodevelopment; Psychosis; adult; amygdaloid nucleus; article; brain development; brain disease; brain size; brain texture; cerebellum; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; cytoarchitecture; discriminant analysis; disease marker; endophenotype; entropy; female; gray matter; hippocampus; human; hypothesis; image analysis; linear discriminant analysis; male; nervous system parameters; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patient identification; priority journal; schizophrenia; Texture analysis; voxel based morphometry","H.D.

Methods: High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 72 patients with idiopathic PD (mean age, 61.08 years) and 73 healthy subjects (mean age, 58.96 years). The whole brain was parcellated into 95 regions of interest using composite anatomical atlases, and region volumes were calculated. Three diagnostic classifiers were constructed using binary multiple logistic regression modeling: the (i) basal ganglion prior classifier, (ii) data-driven classifier, and (iii) basal ganglion prior/data-driven hybrid classifier. Leave-one-out cross validation was used to unbiasedly evaluate the predictive accuracy of imaging features. Pearson’s correlation analysis was further performed to correlate outcome measurement using the best PD classifier with disease severity. Results: Smaller volume in susceptible regions is diagnostic for Parkinson’s disease. Compared with the other two classifiers, the basal ganglion prior/data-driven hybrid classifier had the highest diagnostic reliability with a sensitivity of 74%, specificity of 75%, and accuracy of 74%. Furthermore, outcome measurement using this classifier was associated with disease severity. Conclusions: Brain structural volumetric analysis with multiple logistic regression modeling can be a complementary tool for diagnosing PD. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Brain volume; Gray matter; Movement disorder; MRI; Parkinson’s disease","Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease; Prospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index; adult; amygdala; anterior cingulate; Article; automation; basal ganglion; brain region; brain size; brain tissue; caudate nucleus; cerebellum; cerebellum vermis; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical evaluation; cognition; controlled study; cuneus; daily life activity; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; disease severity; female; fusiform gyrus; gray matter; hippocampus; human; idiopathic disease; inferior frontal gyrus; insula; lingual gyrus; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; middle frontal gyrus; Mini Mental State Examination; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; nucleus accumbens; occipital lobe; orbital cortex; outcome assessment; parietal gyrus; parietal lobe; Parkinson disease; postcentral gyrus; posterior cingulate; predictive value; priority journal; putamen; sensitivity and specificity; superior frontal gyrus; superior temporal gyrus; temporal lobe; thalamus; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; volumetry; voxel based morphometry; white matter; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; procedures; prospective study; severity of illness index","C.-H.

It cannot be prevented, cured or drastically slowed, even though AD research has increased in the past 5-10 years. Instead of focusing on the brain volume or on the single brain structures like hippocampus, this paper investigates the relationship and proximity between regions in the brain and uses this information as a novel way of classifying normal control (NC), mild cognitive impaired (MCI), and AD subjects.Methods: A longitudinal cohort of 528 subjects (170 NC, 240 MCI, and 114 AD) from ADNI at baseline and month 12 was studied. We investigated a marker based on Procrustes aligned center of masses and the percentile surface connectivity between regions. These markers were classified using a linear discriminant analysis in a cross validation setting and compared to whole brain and hippocampus volume.Results: We found that both our markers was able to significantly classify the subjects. The surface connectivity marker showed the best results with an area under the curve (AUC) at 0.877 (p<0.001), 0.784 (p<0.001), 0,766 (p<0.001) for NC-AD, NC-MCI, and MCI-AD, respectively, for the functional regions in the brain. The surface connectivity marker was able to classify MCI-converters with an AUC of 0.599 (p<0.05) for the 1-year period.Conclusion: Our results show that our relative proximity markers include more information than whole brain and hippocampus volume. Our results demonstrate that our proximity markers have the potential to assist in early diagnosis of AD. © 2014 Lillemark et al.","Alzheimer's disease; Bio markers; Diagnosis and classification; Mild cognitive impairment; MRI; Proximity","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Biological Markers; Brain; Connective Tissue; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Reproducibility of Results; biological marker; aged; Alzheimer disease; article; brain; connective tissue; female; human; longitudinal study; male; methodology; middle aged; mild cognitive impairment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; radiography; reproducibility; very elderly","L.

Objectives: A fully automated method for quantitative MRI analysis using atlas-based volumetry combined with support vector machine classification was evaluated for differentiation of parkinsonian syndromes in a multicenter study. Methods: Atlas-based volumetry was performed on MRI data of healthy controls (n = 73) and patients with PD (204), PSP with Richardson's syndrome phenotype (106), MSA of the cerebellar type (21), and MSA of the Parkinsonian type (60), acquired on different scanners. Volumetric results were used as input for support vector machine classification of single subjects with leave-one-out cross-validation. Results: The largest atrophy compared to controls was found for PSP with Richardson's syndrome phenotype patients in midbrain (−15%), midsagittal midbrain tegmentum plane (−20%), and superior cerebellar peduncles (−13%), for MSA of the cerebellar type in pons (−33%), cerebellum (−23%), and middle cerebellar peduncles (−36%), and for MSA of the parkinsonian type in the putamen (−23%). The majority of binary support vector machine classifications between the groups resulted in balanced accuracies of >80%. With MSA of the cerebellar and parkinsonian type combined in one group, support vector machine classification of PD, PSP and MSA achieved sensitivities of 79% to 87% and specificities of 87% to 96%. Extraction of weighting factors confirmed that midbrain, basal ganglia, and cerebellar peduncles had the largest relevance for classification. Conclusions: Brain volumetry combined with support vector machine classification allowed for reliable automated differentiation of parkinsonian syndromes on single-patient level even for MRI acquired on different scanners. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society","magnetic resonance imaging; multiple system atrophy; Parkinson's disease; progressive supranuclear palsy; support vector machine; volumetry","Article; automation; brain function; brain size; cerebellum; comparative study; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; globus pallidus; human; imaging software; major clinical study; mesencephalon; middle cerebellar peduncle; midsagittal midbrain tegmentum; multicenter study; nerve degeneration; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; parkinsonism; phenotype; pons; priority journal; progressive supranuclear palsy; sensitivity and specificity; superior cerebellar peduncle; support vector machine; tegmentum; three dimensional imaging; volumetric nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; volumetry","J.

While longitudinal MRI studies have been traditionally used to assess the issue of progression of brain abnormalities in schizophrenia, information from cross-sectional neuroimaging studies directly comparing first-episode and chronic schizophrenia patients to healthy controls may also be useful to further clarify this issue. With the recent interest in multisite mega-analyses combining structural MRI data from multiple centers aiming at increased statistical power, the present multisite voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study was carried out to examine patterns of brain structural changes according to the different stages of illness and to ascertain which (if any) of such structural abnormalities would be specifically correlated to potential clinical moderators, including cumulative exposure to antipsychotics, age of onset, illness duration and overall illness severity. Methods: We gathered a large sample of schizophrenia patients (161, being 99 chronic and 62 first-episode) and controls (151) from four previous morphometric MRI studies (1.5 T) carried out in the same geographical region of Brazil. Image processing and analyses were conducted using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) software with the diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) algorithm. Group effects on regional gray matter (GM) volumes were investigated through whole-brain voxel-wise comparisons using General Linear Model Analysis of Co-variance (ANCOVA), always including total GM volume, scan protocol, age and gender as nuisance variables. Finally, correlation analyses were performed between the aforementioned clinical moderators and regional and global brain volumes. Results: First-episode schizophrenia subjects displayed subtle volumetric deficits relative to controls in a circumscribed brain regional network identified only in small volume-corrected (SVC) analyses (p < 0.05, FWE-corrected), including the insula, temporolimbic structures and striatum. Chronic schizophrenia patients, on the other hand, demonstrated an extensive pattern of regional GM volume decreases relative to controls, involving bilateral superior, inferior and orbital frontal cortices, right middle frontal cortex, bilateral anterior cingulate cortices, bilateral insulae and right superior and middle temporal cortices (p < 0.05, FWE-corrected over the whole brain). GM volumes in several of those brain regions were directly correlated with age of disease onset on SVC analyses for conjoined (first-episode and chronic) schizophrenia groups. There were also widespread foci of significant negative correlation between duration of illness and relative GM volumes, but such findings remained significant only for the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex after accounting for the influence of age of disease onset. Finally, significant negative correlations were detected between life-time cumulative exposure to antipsychotics and total GM and white matter volumes in schizophrenia patients, but no significant relationship was found between indices of antipsychotic usage and relative GM volume in any specific brain region. Conclusion: The above data indicate that brain changes associated with the diagnosis of schizophrenia are more widespread in chronic schizophrenia compared to first-episode patients. Our findings also suggest that relative GM volume deficits may be greater in (presumably more severe) cases with earlier age of onset, as well as varying as a function of illness duration in specific frontal brain regions. Finally, our results highlight the potentially complex effects of the continued use of antipsychotic drugs on structural brain abnormalities in schizophrenia, as we found that cumulative doses of antipsychotics affected brain volumes globally rather than selectively on frontal-temporal regions. © 2016 The Authors.

Methods: Participants (n 119) were randomized to placebo or resveratrol 500 mg orally once daily (with dose escalation by 500-mg increments every 13 weeks, ending with 1,000 mg twice daily). Brain MRI and CSF collection were performed at baseline and after completion of treatment. Detailed pharmacokinetics were performed on a subset (n 15) at baseline and weeks 13, 26, 39, and 52. Results: Resveratrol and its major metabolites were measurable in plasma and CSF. The most common adverse events were nausea, diarrhea, and weight loss. CSF Aβ40 and plasma Aβ40 levels declined more in the placebo group than the resveratrol-treated group, resulting in a significant difference at week 52. Brain volume loss was increased by resveratrol treatment compared to placebo. Conclusions: Resveratrol was safe and well-tolerated. Resveratrol and its major metabolites penetrated the blood-brain barrier to have CNS effects. Further studies are required to interpret the biomarker changes associated with resveratrol treatment. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with AD resveratrol is safe, well-tolerated, and alters some AD biomarker trajectories. The study is rated Class II because more than 2 primary outcomes were designated. © 2015 American Academy of Neurology.","","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Double-Blind Method; Female; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Stilbenes; amyloid beta protein[1-40]; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; biological marker; drug metabolite; phospho tau 181 protein; phosphoprotein; placebo; resveratrol; tau protein; unclassified drug; resveratrol; stilbene derivative; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; arthralgia; Article; backache; basal cell carcinoma; bladder cancer; body weight disorder; brain size; chronotherapy; connective tissue disease; controlled study; diarrhea; disease severity; dose response; double blind procedure; drowning; drug dose escalation; drug efficacy; drug eruption; drug fatality; drug half life; drug induced disease; drug intoxication; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; evening dosage; evidence based practice; eye disease; female; gastrointestinal disease; glioblastoma; headache; heart disease; human; infection complication; infestation; injury; kidney disease; lung melanoma; lung tumor; major clinical study; male; maximum plasma concentration; mediastinum disease; melanoma; mental disease; metabolic disorder; morning dosage; multicenter study; musculoskeletal disease; nausea; neoplasm; neuroimaging; neurologic disease; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nutritional disorder; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; protein blood level; protein cerebrospinal fluid level; randomized controlled trial; respiratory tract disease; skin disease; soft tissue disease; squamous cell carcinoma; thorax disease; time to maximum plasma concentration; treatment duration; treatment outcome; treatment response; urinary tract disease; vascular disease; Alzheimer disease; blood; chemically induced; clinical trial; Gastrointestinal Diseases; middle aged; very elderly","R.S.

We previously reported that marijuana misuse in conjunction with specific cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) genetic variants (rs12720071-G-allele carriers) contributed to white-matter (WM) brain volume deficits in schizophrenia patients. In this study, we assessed the influence of another cannabinoid-related gene, mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14), and potential MAPK14-CNR1 gene-gene interactions in conferring brain volume abnormalities among schizophrenia patients with marijuana abuse/dependence. MAPK14 encodes a member of the MAPK family involved in diverse cellular processes, including CNR1-induced apoptosis. Method We genotyped 235 schizophrenia patients on nine MAPK14 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs). Approximately one quarter of the sample had marijuana abuse or dependence. Differential effects of MAPK14 tSNPs on brain volumes across patients with versus without marijuana abuse/dependence were examined using ANCOVA. Results Of the MAPK14 tSNPs, only rs12199654 had significant genotype effects and genotypeÂ ×Â marijuana misuse interaction effects on WM volumes. rs12199654-A homozygotes with marijuana abuse/dependence had significantly smaller total cerebral and lobar WM volumes. The effects of MAPK14 rs12199654 on WM volume deficits remained significant even after controlling for the CNR1 rs12720071 genotype. There were significant main effects of the MAPK14 CNR1 diplotype and diplotypeÂ ×Â marijuana interaction on WM brain volumes, with both genetic variants having additive contributions to WM volume deficits only in patients with marijuana misuse. Conclusions Given that CNR1-induced apoptosis is preceded by increased MAPK phosphorylation, our study suggests that potential MAPK14-CNR1 gene-gene interactions may mediate brain morphometric features in schizophrenia patients with heavy marijuana use. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.","epistasis; gene-environment interaction; Key words Cannabis; MRI; white matter","Adolescent; Adult; Alleles; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Apoptosis; Brain; Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry); Epistasis, Genetic; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Linkage Disequilibrium; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Marijuana Abuse; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14; Organ Size; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Rats; Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1; Schizophrenia; Young Adult; cannabinoid 1 receptor; CNR1 protein, human; mitogen activated protein kinase 14; MLCS; MLOWN; adolescent; adult; allele; analysis of variance; animal; apoptosis; article; brain; cannabis addiction; epistasis; female; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic predisposition; genetics; genotype; human; image processing; male; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; psychiatric diagnosis; rat; schizophrenia; single nucleotide polymorphism","B.-C.

Particular attention has been focused on measuring volumes of brain structures. Only few studies have investigated-whether the cerebellar volume changes with the stage of dementia. It is controversial whether the serum apolipoprotein E (ApoE) level is an appropriate AD marker. This study was designed to clarify the significance of both cerebellar volume measurements and ApoE level measurements as markers of neurodegenerative changes. This study included 55 subjects with AD, 30 subjects with mild cognitive impairments (MCI), and a control group with 30 subjects. We measured the brain, cerebellum, and brain stem volumes with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We determined serum ApoE levels, APOE genotypes, and neuropsychological test scores. In the control group, we found that ApoE levels were significantly higher for subjects with the APOE 2/3 genotype than those with the 4/4 genotype. This finding may indicate that ApoE plays a protective role against AD development in subjects with the APOE 2/3 genotype. ApoE levels were not significantly different in patients with AD and MCI. No correlations were found between serum ApoE levels and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores or the volumes of brain structures. This study could not confirm the appropriateness of the cerebellum volume as an early AD marker. Correlations were found between cerebellar volume, brain volume, and the MMSE scores. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.","Alzheimer's disease; APOE genotype; Apolipoprotein E; Brain volume; Cerebellum; Mild cognitive impairment","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoproteins E; Atrophy; Brain; Cerebellum; Cognition Disorders; Disease Progression; Female; Genotype; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Neuropsychological Tests; Organ Size; apolipoprotein E; aged; Alzheimer disease; article; brain size; brain stem; cerebellum; controlled study; correlational study; disease course; female; genotype; human; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; Mini Mental State Examination; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; protein blood level","W.

Subtle changes in these domains are detectable up to 15 years before a definitive motor diagnosis is made. This period, called prodromal HD, provides an opportunity to examine lifestyle behaviors that may impact disease progression. Theoretical Framework: Physical activity relates to decreased rates of brain atrophy and improved cognitive and day-to-day functioning in Alzheimer disease and healthy aging populations. Previous research has yielded mixed results regarding the impact of physical activity on disease progression in HD and paid little attention to the prodromal phase. Methods: We conducted analyses of associations among current physical activity level, current and retrospective rate of change for hippocampus and striatum volume, and cognitive, motor, and day-to-day functioning variables. Participants were 48 gene-expanded cases with prodromal and early-diagnosed HD and 27 nongene-expanded control participants. Participants wore Fitbit Ultra activity monitors for three days and completed the self-reported International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Hippocampal and striatal white matter volumes were measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Cognitive tests included the Stroop Color and Word Test, and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Motor function was assessed using the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale total motor score (TMS). Day-to-day functioning was measured using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) version 2.0. Results: Higher Fitbit activity scores were significantly related to better scores on the SDMT and WHODAS in case participants but not in controls. Fitbit activity scores tracked better with TMS scores in the group as a whole, though the association did not reach statistical significance in the case participants. Higher Fitbit activity scores related to less day-to-day functioning decline in retrospective slope analyses. Fitbit activity scores did not differ significantly between cases and controls. Conclusions: This is the first known study examining the associations between activity level and imaging, motor, cognitive, and day-to-day functioning outcomes in prodromal and early HD. Preliminary results suggest physical activity positively correlates with improved cognitive and day-to-day functioning and possibly motor function in individuals in the prodromal and early phase of the condition. © 2016, Public Library of Science.

We tried to identify structural changes of the brain that best discriminate between schizophrenia and MDD on the basis of gray matter volume, ventricle volume, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Method: The first exploration sample consisted of 25 female patients with schizophrenia and 25 females with MDD. Regional brain volumes and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were entered into a discriminant analysis. The second validation sample consisted of 18 female schizophrenia and 16 female MDD patients. Results: The stepwise discriminant analysis resulted in correct classification rates of 0.80 in the schizophrenic group and 0.76 in MDD. In the second validation sample, the obtained model yielded correct classification rates of 0.72 in the schizophrenia group and 0.88 in the MDD group. Conclusion: Our results suggest that schizophrenia and MDD have differential structural changes in the examined brain regions and that the obtained discriminant score may be useful to discriminate the two disorders. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Diffusion tensor imaging; Discriminant analysis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Major depressive disorder; Schizophrenia","Adult; Anisotropy; Brain; Depressive Disorder, Major; Discriminant Analysis; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Reference Values; Schizophrenia; Diffusion tensor imaging; Discriminant analysis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Major depressive disorder; Schizophrenia; adult; article; brain region; brain size; brain ventricle; differential diagnosis; diffusion tensor imaging; discriminant analysis; female; fractional anisotropy; gray matter; human; major clinical study; major depression; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; schizophrenia","M.

For example, the statistically defined distribution of normal ageing brain tissue volumes may be used as a reference to assess patient volumes. To date, such models were often derived from mean values which were assumed to represent the distributions and boundaries, i.e. percentile ranks, of brain tissue volume. Since it was previously unknown, the objective of the present study was to determine if this assumption was robust, i.e. whether regression models derived from mean values accurately represented the distributions and boundaries of brain tissue volume at older ages. Materials and Methods: We acquired T1-w magnetic resonance (MR) brain images of 227 normal and 219 Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects (aged 55-89 years) from publicly available databanks. Using nonlinear regression within both samples, we compared mean and percentile rank estimates of whole brain tissue volume by age. Results: In both the normal and AD sample, mean regression estimates of brain tissue volume often did not accurately represent percentile rank estimates (errors=-74% to 75%). In the normal sample, mean estimates generally underestimated differences in brain volume at percentile ranks below the mean. Conversely, in the AD sample, mean estimates generally underestimated differences in brain volume at percentile ranks above the mean. Differences between ages at the 5th percentile rank of normal subjects were ∼39% greater than mean differences in the AD subjects. Conclusions: While more data are required to make true population inferences, our results indicate that mean regression estimates may not accurately represent the distributions of ageing brain tissue volumes. This suggests that percentile rank estimates will be required to robustly define the limits of brain tissue volume in normal ageing and neurodegenerative disease. © 2013 Dickie et al.","","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Reference Values; Regression Analysis; adult; aged; aging; Alzheimer disease; article; brain size; brain tissue; controlled study; degenerative disease; diffusion weighted imaging; female; human; human tissue; image analysis; image processing; incidence; major clinical study; male; neuroimaging; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; very elderly","","","","19326203","","POLNC","24367629","English","PLoS ONE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893204117"

The study setting was the Oulu Brain and Mind Study, with subjects drawn from the Northern Finland 1986 Birth Cohort (n = 9479) using register and questionnaire based screening, and interviews using the Structured Interview for Prodromal Symptoms. After this procedure, 172 subjects were included in the study, classified as controls (n = 73) and three risk groups: FR excluding CR (FR, n = 60), CR without FR (CR, n = 26), and individuals at both FR and CR (FRCR, n = 13). T1-weighted brain scans were acquired and processed in a voxel-based analysis using permutation-based statistics. In the comparison between FRCR versus controls, we found lower grey matter volume (GMV) in a cluster (1689 voxels at - 4.00, - 72.00, - 18.00. mm) covering both cerebellar hemispheres and the vermis. This cluster was subsequently used as a mask to extract mean GMV in all four groups: FR had a volume intermediate between controls and FRCR. Within FRCR there was an association between cerebellar cluster brain volume and motor function. These findings are consistent with an evolving pattern of cerebellar deficits in psychosis risk with the most pronounced deficits in those at highest risk of psychosis. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Cerebellum; Clinical risk; Family risk; MRI; Prodrome; Schizophrenia","Adult; Brain; Cohort Studies; Female; Finland; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Prodromal Symptoms; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychomotor Performance; Psychotic Disorders; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; article; cerebellum vermis; clinical risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; family risk; female; Finland; gray matter; human; male; neuroanatomy; population research; priority journal; prodromal symptom; psychosis; risk factor; structured interview; voxel based morphometry; brain; classification; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; prodromal symptom; psychological rating scale; psychomotor performance; psychosis; questionnaire; regression analysis; risk factor","G.K.

To estimate such regional brain volumes, the intracranial cavity volume (ICV) is often used for normalization. However, the high variability of brain shape and size due to normal intersubject variability, normal changes occurring over the lifespan, and abnormal changes due to disease makes the ICV estimation problem challenging. In this paper, we present a new approach to perform ICV extraction based on the use of a library of prelabeled brain images to capture the large variability of brain shapes. To this end, an improved nonlocal label fusion scheme based on BEaST technique is proposed to increase the accuracy of the ICV estimation. The proposed method is compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and the results demonstrate an improved performance both in terms of accuracy and reproducibility while maintaining a reduced computational burden. © 2014 José V.

However, finding a good representation for multivariate brain MRI features in which their essential structure is revealed and easily extractable has been difficult. We report a successful application of a machine learning framework that significantly improved the use of brain MRI for predictions. Specifically, we used the unsupervised learning algorithm of local linear embedding (LLE) to transform multivariate MRI data of regional brain volume and cortical thickness to a locally linear space with fewer dimensions, while also utilizing the global nonlinear data structure. The embedded brain features were then used to train a classifier for predicting future conversion to AD based on a baseline MRI. We tested the approach on 413 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had baseline MRI scans and complete clinical follow-ups over 3. years with the following diagnoses: cognitive normal (CN; n. = 137), stable mild cognitive impairment (s-MCI; n. = 93), MCI converters to AD (c-MCI, n. = 97), and AD (n. = 86). We found that classifications using embedded MRI features generally outperformed (p. <. 0.05) classifications using the original features directly. Moreover, the improvement from LLE was not limited to a particular classifier but worked equally well for regularized logistic regressions, support vector machines, and linear discriminant analysis. Most strikingly, using LLE significantly improved (p. = 0.007) predictions of MCI subjects who converted to AD and those who remained stable (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity: = 0.68/0.80/0.56). In contrast, predictions using the original features performed not better than by chance (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity: = 0.56/0.65/0.46). In conclusion, LLE is a very effective tool for classification studies of AD using multivariate MRI data. The improvement in predicting conversion to AD in MCI could have important implications for health management and for powering therapeutic trials by targeting non-demented subjects who later convert to AD. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Alzheimer's disease; Classification of AD; Locally linear embedding; MRI; Statistical learning","Aged; Algorithms; Alzheimer Disease; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; aged; Alzheimer disease; article; brain size; classifier; controlled study; cortical thickness (brain); disease classification; female; human; learning algorithm; local linear embedding; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parietal lobe; priority journal; temporal lobe; algorithm; Alzheimer disease; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; image enhancement; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model","X.

A concrete interpretation of proverbs, however, may reflect semantic impairments from anterior temporal lobes, rather than executive dysfunction from frontal lobes. The investigation of proverb interpretation among patients with different dementias with varying degrees of temporal and frontal dysfunction may clarify the underlying brain-behavior mechanisms for abstraction from proverbs. We propose that patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), who are characteristically more impaired on proverb interpretation than those with Alzheimer's disease (AD), are disproportionately impaired because of anterior temporal-mediated semantic deficits. Methods: Eleven patients with bvFTD and 10 with AD completed the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Proverbs Test and a series of neuropsychological measures of executive and semantic functions. The analysis included both raw and age-adjusted normed data for multiple choice responses on the D-KEFS Proverbs Test using independent samples t-tests. Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) applied to 3D T1-weighted MRI scans mapped the association between regional brain volume and proverb performance. Computations of mean Jacobian values within select regions of interest provided a numeric summary of regional volume, and voxel-wise regression yielded 3D statistical maps of the association between tissue volume and proverb scores. Results: The patients with bvFTD were significantly worse than those with AD in proverb interpretation. The worse performance of the bvFTD patients involved a greater number of concrete responses to common, familiar proverbs, but not to uncommon, unfamiliar ones. These concrete responses to common proverbs correlated with semantic measures, whereas concrete responses to uncommon proverbs correlated with executive functions. After controlling for dementia diagnosis, TBM analyses indicated significant correlations between impaired proverb interpretation and the anterior temporal lobe region (left>right). Conclusions: Among two dementia groups, those with bvFTD, demonstrated a greater number of concrete responses to common proverbs compared to those with AD, and this performance correlated with semantic deficits and the volume of the left anterior lobe, the hub of semantic knowledge. The findings of this study suggest that common proverb interpretation is greatly influenced by semantic dysfunction and that the use of proverbs for testing executive functions needs to include the interpretation of unfamiliar proverbs. © 2013.","Alzheimer's disease; Executive functioning; Frontotemporal dementia; MRI; Proverbs; Tensor based morphometry","Alzheimer Disease; Aphorisms and Proverbs as Topic; Brain; Female; Frontotemporal Dementia; Humans; Language Disorders; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Semantics; Alzheimer's disease; Executive functioning; Frontotemporal dementia; MRI; Proverbs; Tensor based morphometry; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; article; Boston naming test; brain dysfunction; brain function; brain radiography; brain size; clinical article; controlled study; Delis Kaplan Executive Function System Design Fluency subtest; Delis Kaplan Executive Function System Proverb subtest; Delis Kaplan Executive Function System Tower subtest; diffusion weighted imaging; executive function; female; frontal lobe; frontotemporal dementia; human; literature; male; morphometrics; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Phonemic FAS Fluency; Pyramid and Palm Tree Test; Semantic Animal Fluency; semantics; Stroop C; temporal lobe; tensor based morphometry; Trails B; Wisconson Card Sorting Test","N.C.

A non-invasive method of determining brain tau burden in vivo would allow a better understanding of the pathophysiology of tauopathies. The purpose of the study was to evaluate 18F-THK523 as a potential tau imaging tracer. Methods: Ten healthy elderly controls, three semantic dementia (SD) and ten AD patients underwent neuropsychological examination, MRI as well as 18F-THK523 and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Composite memory and non-memory scores, global and hippocampal brain volume, and partial volume-corrected tissue ratios for 18F-THK523 and 11C-PIB were estimated for all participants. Correlational analyses were performed between global and regional 18F-THK523, 11C-PIB, cognition and brain volumetrics. Results: 18F-THK523 presented with fast reversible kinetics. Significantly higher 18F-THK523 retention was observed in the temporal, parietal, orbitofrontal and hippocampi of AD patients when compared to healthy controls and SD patients. White matter retention was significantly higher than grey matter retention in all participants. The pattern of cortical 18F-THK523 retention did not correlate with Aβ distribution as assessed by 11C-PIB and followed the known distribution of tau in the AD brain, being higher in temporal and parietal areas than in the frontal region. Unlike 11C-PIB, hippocampal 18F-THK523 retention was correlated with several cognitive parameters and with hippocampal atrophy. Conclusion: 18F-THK523 does not bind to Aβ in vivo, while following the known distribution of paired helical filaments (PHF)-tau in the brain. Significantly higher cortical 18F-THK523 retention in AD patients as well as the association of hippocampal 18F-THK523 retention with cognitive parameters and hippocampal volume suggests 18F-THK523 selectively binds to tau in AD patients. Unfortunately, the very high 18F-THK523 retention in white matter precludes simple visual inspection of the images, preventing its use in research or clinical settings. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Alzheimer's disease; Aβ Imaging; Brain; Neurodegeneration; Tau imaging","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Aniline Compounds; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Female; Frontotemporal Dementia; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Positron-Emission Tomography; Protein Binding; Quinolines; Radiopharmaceuticals; tau Proteins; Thiazoles; Tissue Distribution; carbon 11; fluorine 18; Pittsburgh compound B; tau protein; 2-(4'-(methylamino)phenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole; 2-(4-aminophenyl)-6-(2-fluoroethoxy)quinoline; amyloid beta protein; aniline derivative; MAPT protein, human; protein binding; quinoline derivative; radiopharmaceutical agent; tau protein; thiazole derivative; aged; Alzheimer disease; article; brain size; clinical article; clinical trial; cognition; controlled study; female; human; imaging system; in vivo study; male; molecular imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; orbital cortex; parietal cortex; positron emission tomography; psychologic test; semantic dementia; tauopathy; very elderly; white matter; Alzheimer disease; brain; case control study; diagnostic use; evaluation study; frontotemporal dementia; metabolism; middle aged; scintiscanning; tissue distribution","V.L.

The advent of radiotracers for amyloid imaging presents an opportunity to investigate amyloid deposition in vivo. The 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB)-PET ligand remains the most widely studied to date; however, regional variations in 11C-PiB binding and the extent of agreement with neuropathological assessment have not been thoroughly investigated. Sojkova and colleagues [35] reported variable agreement between CERAD-based neuropathologic diagnosis of AD lesions and mean cortical PiB, suggesting the need for a more direct quantification of regional Aβ in relation to in vivo imaging. In the present study, we extend these findings by examining the correspondence among regional 11C-PiB load, region-matched quantitative immunohistological assessments of Aβ and NFTs, and brain atrophy (MRI) in six older Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants who came to autopsy (imaging-autopsy interval range 0.2-2.4 years). The total number of Aβ plaques (6E10) and NFTs (PHF1) in paraffin sections from hippocampus, orbito-frontal cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus and cerebellum was quantified using a technique guided by unbiased stereological principles. We report a general agreement between the regional measures of amyloid obtained via stereological assessment and imaging, with significant relationships evident for the anterior (r = 0.83; p = 0.04) and posterior (r = 0.94; p = 0.005) cingulate gyri, and the precuneus (r = 0.94; p = 0.005). No associations were observed between 11C-PiB load and NFT count for any of the regions examined (p > 0.2 in all regions), or between regional Aβ or NFT counts and corresponding brain volumes. The strong associations of PiB retention with region-matched, quantitative analyses of Aβ in postmortem tissue offer support for the validity of 11C-PiB-PET imaging as a method for evaluation of plaque burden in vivo. © 2012 Springer-Verlag (outside the USA).","Alzheimer; Neuroimaging; PiB; Plaques; Stereology; Tangles","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Autopsy; Benzothiazoles; Female; Humans; Male; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Neuroimaging; Plaque, Amyloid; Positron-Emission Tomography; amyloid beta protein; Pittsburgh compound B; tau protein; aged; amyloid plaque; anterior cingulate; article; autopsy; brain atrophy; brain radiography; brain region; brain size; cerebellum; clinical article; clinical assessment; disease association; female; hippocampus; human; human tissue; immunohistology; in vivo study; male; neurofibrillary tangle; neuroimaging; orbital cortex; positron emission tomography; posterior cingulate; precuneus; priority journal; quantitative analysis; tissue distribution","I.

Reductions in the size of the corpus callosum (CC) have been described for schizophrenia patients, but little is known about the possible regional differences in schizophrenia subtypes (paranoid, disorganised, undifferentiated, residual).; Methods. We recruited 58 chronically schizophrenic patients with different subtypes, and 31 age-and-gender matched healthy controls. The callosum was extracted from a midsagittal slice from T1 weighted magnetic resonance images, and areas of the total CC, its five subregions, CC length and total brain volume were compared between schizophrenia subtypes and controls. Five subregions were approximately matched to fibre pathways from cortical regions.; Results. Schizophrenia patients had reduced CC total area and length when compared with controls. Disorganised and undifferentiated schizophrenics had a smaller prefrontal area, while there was no significant difference for the paranoid and residual groups. The premotor/ supplementary motor area was smaller in all schizophrenia subtypes. The motor area was smaller only in the disorganised group. A smaller sensory area was found in all subtypes except the residual group. Parietal, temporal and occipital areas were smaller in the paranoid and undifferentiated groups. Total brain volume was smaller in all schizophrenia subtypes compared with controls, but did not reach statistical significance.; Conclusion. These findings suggest that the heterogeneity of symptoms may lead to the different CC morphological characteristics in schizophrenia subtypes. © 2014, South African Medical Association.

Often techniques are compared through computation of required sample size estimates for future clinical trials. However interpretation of such comparisons is rendered complex because, despite using the same publicly available cohorts, the various techniques have been assessed with different data exclusions and different statistical analysis models. We created the MIRIAD atrophy challenge in order to test various capabilities of atrophy measurement techniques. The data consisted of 69 subjects (46 Alzheimer's disease, 23 control) who were scanned multiple (up to twelve) times at nine visits over a follow-up period of one to two years, resulting in 708 total image sets. Nine participating groups from 6 countries completed the challenge by providing volumetric measurements of key structures (whole brain, lateral ventricle, left and right hippocampi) for each dataset and atrophy measurements of these structures for each time point pair (both forward and backward) of a given subject. From these results, we formally compared techniques using exactly the same dataset. First, we assessed the repeatability of each technique using rates obtained from short intervals where no measurable atrophy is expected. For those measures that provided direct measures of atrophy between pairs of images, we also assessed symmetry and transitivity. Then, we performed a statistical analysis in a consistent manner using linear mixed effect models. The models, one for repeated measures of volume made at multiple time-points and a second for repeated ""direct"" measures of change in brain volume, appropriately allowed for the correlation between measures made on the same subject and were shown to fit the data well. From these models, we obtained estimates of the distribution of atrophy rates in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and control groups and of required sample sizes to detect a 25% treatment effect, in relation to healthy ageing, with 95% significance and 80% power over follow-up periods of 6, 12, and 24. months. Uncertainty in these estimates, and head-to-head comparisons between techniques, were carried out using the bootstrap. The lateral ventricles provided the most stable measurements, followed by the brain. The hippocampi had much more variability across participants, likely because of differences in segmentation protocol and less distinct boundaries. Most methods showed no indication of bias based on the short-term interval results, and direct measures provided good consistency in terms of symmetry and transitivity. The resulting annualized rates of change derived from the model ranged from, for whole brain: - 1.4% to - 2.2% (AD) and - 0.35% to - 0.67% (control), for ventricles: 4.6% to 10.2% (AD) and 1.2% to 3.4% (control), and for hippocampi: - 1.5% to - 7.0% (AD) and - 0.4% to - 1.4% (control). There were large and statistically significant differences in the sample size requirements between many of the techniques. The lowest sample sizes for each of these structures, for a trial with a 12. month follow-up period, were 242 (95% CI: 154 to 422) for whole brain, 168 (95% CI: 112 to 282) for ventricles, 190 (95% CI: 146 to 268) for left hippocampi, and 158 (95% CI: 116 to 228) for right hippocampi. This analysis represents one of the most extensive statistical comparisons of a large number of different atrophy measurement techniques from around the globe. The challenge data will remain online and publicly available so that other groups can assess their methods. © 2015.","","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Brain; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain atrophy; brain size; comparative study; controlled study; follow up; hippocampus; human; lateral brain ventricle; major clinical study; measurement repeatability; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; radiological parameters; radiological procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); aged; Alzheimer disease; atrophy; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; female; male; middle aged; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; statistical analysis","","","Academic Press Inc.","10538119","","NEIME","26275383","English","NeuroImage","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942250272"

This study aims to clarify the neuropathologic correlates of longitudinal brain atrophy. Objective: To examine the association between brain atrophy during life and neuropathology in an elderly population. Design: Autopsy study of a cohort of elderly individuals. Setting: Community-based population. Participants: Seventy-one healthy elderly individuals were selected from participants of the Oregon Brain Aging Study for having an autopsy, more than 1 magnetic resonance imaging scan, and the last magnetic resonance imaging scan within 36 months of death. Main Outcomes and Measures: The associations between brain volume trajectories (ventricular, total brain, and hippocampal) and time interaction terms for neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, gross infarcts, microinfarcts, amyloid angiopathy, Lewy bodies, APOE ε4 presence, and clinical diagnosis (no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia as time-varying covariates) were examined in mixed-effects models, adjusting for duration of follow-up and age at death. Results: Ventricular volume trajectory was significantly associated with age, presence of infarcts, neurofibrillary tangle and neuritic plaque scores, APOE ε4 allele presence, and dementia diagnosis. Total brain volume trajectory was significantly associated with age and mild cognitive impairment diagnosis. Hippocampal volume trajectory was significantly associated with amyloid angiopathy. Conclusions and Relevance: Ventricular volume trajectory is more sensitive than total brain and hippocampal volume trajectories as a marker of accruing Alzheimer disease and vascular pathology in elderly individuals. The association between brain volume trajectories and cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment and dementia) remained after controlling for the degree of neuropathology and other covariates. This suggests that there may be other factors not measured in this study that could be contributing to brain atrophy in those with cognitive impairment. ©2013 American Medical Association.

Using these ratios as an adjunct to visual image assessment has been shown to improve inter-reader reliability, however, the amyloid positivity threshold is dependent on the tracer and specific image regions used to calculate the uptake ratio. To address this problem, we propose a machine learning approach to amyloid status classification, which is independent of tracer and does not require a specific set of regions of interest. Our method extracts feature vectors from amyloid images, which are based on histograms of oriented three-dimensional gradients. We optimised our method on 133 18F-florbetapir brain volumes, and applied it to a separate test set of 131 volumes. Using the same parameter settings, we then applied our method to 209 11C-PiB images and 128 18F-florbetaben images. We compared our method to classification results achieved using two other methods: standardised uptake value ratios and a machine learning method based on voxel intensities. Our method resulted in the largest mean distances between the subjects and the classification boundary, suggesting that it is less likely to make low-confidence classification decisions. Moreover, our method obtained the highest classification accuracy for all three tracers, and consistently achieved above 96% accuracy. © 2016 The Authors","Amyloid; Classification; Florbetaben; Florbetapir; Pittsburgh compound B; Positron emission tomography","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid; Aniline Compounds; Brain; Carbon Radioisotopes; Ethylene Glycols; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Male; Positron-Emission Tomography; Radiopharmaceuticals; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stilbenes; Support Vector Machine; amyloid; florbetapir f 18; Pittsburgh compound B; 4-(N-methylamino)-4'-(2-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)stilbene; amyloid; aniline derivative; carbon; ethylene glycol derivative; florbetapir; radiopharmaceutical agent; stilbene derivative; accuracy; adult; aged; anterior cingulate; Article; brain size; cerebellum; cerebellum cortex; female; frontal lobe; histogram; histogram of oriented gradient; human; image quality; major clinical study; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parietal lobe; posterior cingulate; precuneus; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; support vector machine; temporal lobe; three dimensional imaging; Alzheimer disease; brain; classification; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; metabolism; positron emission tomography; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; very elderly","L.

MRI scans from a subset of 101 subjects from the ADNI study at baseline was used for this study. 40 regions in the brain including hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, white, and gray matter were segmented using FreeSurfer. From this data, we calculated the distance between the center of mass of each region, the normalized number of voxels and the percentage volume and surface connectivity shared between the regions. These markers were used for classification using a linear discriminant analysis in a leave-one-out manner. We found that the percentage of surface and volume connectivity between regions gave a significant classification between NC and AD and borderline significant between MCI and AD even after correction for whole brain volume at baseline. The results show that the morphometric connectivity markers include more information than whole brain volume or distance markers. This suggests that one can gain additional information by combining morphometric connectivity markers with traditional volume and shape markers. © 2013 SPIE.","","Brain; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Alzheimer disease; Center of mass; Connectivity analysis; Gray matter; Leave-one-out; Linear discriminant analysis; Normal controls; Whole brains; Image processing","","","","16057422","978-081949443-6","","","English","Progr.

However, substantial variability in the impairments exists within and among SCZ, FR and healthy controls (HC). A cluster-analytic approach can group individuals based on profiles of traits and create more homogeneous groupings than predefined categories. Here, we investigated differences in the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) neuropsychological battery (six subscales) among SCZ, unaffected FR and HC. To identify three homogeneous and meaningful cognitive groups regardless of categorical diagnoses (SCZ, FR and HC), cognitive clustering was performed, and differences in the BACS subscales among the cognitive cluster groups were investigated. Finally, the effects of diagnosis and cognition on brain volumes were examined. As expected, there were significant differences in the five BACS subscales among the diagnostic groups. The cluster-analytic approach generated three meaningful subgroups: (i) neuropsychologically normal, (ii) intermediate impaired and (iii) widespread impaired. The cognitive subgroups were mainly affected by the clinical diagnosis, and significant differences in all BACS subscales among clusters were found. The effects of the diagnosis and cognitive clusters on brain volumes overlapped in the frontal, temporal and limbic regions. Frontal and temporal volumes were mainly affected by the diagnosis, whereas the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) volumes were affected by the additive effects of diagnosis and cognition. Our findings demonstrate a cognitive continuum among SCZ, FR and HC and support the concept of cognitive impairment and the related ACC volumes as intermediate phenotypes in SCZ. © 2017 The Authors","Anterior cingulate cortex; Brain volume; Cognitive clustering; First-degree relative; Schizophrenia","Adult; Aged; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Schizophrenia; Young Adult; chlorpromazine; adult; amygdala; anterior cingulate; Article; brain size; Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia; clinical article; cognition; cognition assessment; cognitive defect; cognitive function test; controlled study; disease association; female; first-degree relative; frontal cortex; hippocampus; human; insula; limbic cortex; male; mental patient; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; post hoc analysis; priority journal; psychiatric diagnosis; psychopharmacotherapy; schizophrenia; superior temporal gyrus; temporal cortex; aged; cingulate gyrus; cognition; cognitive defect; image processing; middle aged; neuropsychological test; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; schizophrenia; young adult","K.

The purpose of this study was to produce a fully automatic volumetric segmented brain image system (AVSIS) and to evaluate its utility for measuring hippocampal volumes and total intracranial volume (TIV). Materials and methods. We developed a combination technique comprising an anatomical standardization technique to measure TIV, whole brain volume (WBV), and hippocampal volume obtained by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Altogether, 15 healthy volunteers and 15 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) underwent three-dimensional spoiled gradient echo (3D-SPGR) imaging. Three measurements were performed by manual volumetry as the gold standard, a previous semiautomatic method, and our new method, AVSIS. Results. WBV and hippocampal volume in the AD group were significantly smaller than those in the healthy volunteer group measured by the semiautomatic method, manual method, and AVSIS. Each volume measured by AVSIS or semiautomatic method correlated with that measured by the manual method. The correlation coefficients between TIVs, WBVs, or hippocampal volumes measured by AVSIS and the manual method were 0.910, 0.902, and 0.918, respectively; the correlation coefficients between TIVs, or WBVs, measured by the previous semiautomatic method and the manual method were 0.875, and 0.886, respectively. Conclusion. We developed a system for a fully automatic measurement of segmented brain structures and obtained good results. © Japan Radiological Society 2006.","Alzheimer's disease; Brain; Hippocampus; Magnetic resonance imaging; Volumetry","Age Factors; Aged; Algorithms; Alzheimer Disease; Automatic Data Processing; Brain; Brain Mapping; Case-Control Studies; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Japan; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Alzheimer disease; article; brain region; clinical article; computer assisted diagnosis; controlled study; hippocampus; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; three dimensional echocardiography; volumetry","K.

In contrast to other studies on MRI-based biomarkers which usually only focus on a single modality, we derived deformation maps from high-dimensional normalization of T1-weighted images, as well as mean diffusivity maps and fractional anisotropy maps from DTI of the same group of 21 patients with AD and 20 healthy controls. Using an automated multivariate analysis of the entire brain volume, widespread decreased white matter integrity and atrophy effects were found in cortical and subcortical regions of AD patients. Mean diffusivity maps and deformation maps were equally effective in discriminating between AD patients and controls (AUC =0.88 vs. AUC=0.85) while fractional anisotropy maps performed slightly inferior. Combining the maps from different modalities in a logistic regression model resulted in a classification accuracy of AUC=0.86 after leave-one-out cross-validation. It remains to be shown if this automated multivariate analysis of DTI-measures can improve early diagnosis of AD in predementia stages. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors.

METHODS: This was a post-hoc exploratory analysis from a 3-4-year, randomized, placebo-controlled study of rivastigmine in participants with MCI (InDDEx study). Participants who consented to genetic testing were included in the current analyses. The incidence of progression to AD, cognitive decline and changes in MRI brain volumes were investigated in participants from the placebo arm of the InDDEx study. RESULTS: Of the 1018 participants in the overall study, 464 were successfully genotyped for both APOE and butyrylcholinesterase. Of these, 68 (14.7%) carried ≥1 APOE ε4 and ≥1 BCHE-K allele. The presence of APOE ε4 was associated with a significantly higher incidence of progression to AD whereas the presence of BCHE-K had no independent effect on progression. A synergistic effect of the combined presence of APOE ε4 and BCHE-K on the time to clinical diagnosis of AD and on MRI brain volumes was seen. Progression to AD and hippocampal volumetric loss was greatest in participants who carried both APOE ε4 and BCHE-K alleles and lowest in BCHE-K carriers without the APOE ε4 allele. CONCLUSION: In MCI, the risk of cognitive decline, hippocampal volumetric loss and progression to AD seems to be the greatest in individuals who carry at least one copy of both the BCHE-K and APOE ε4 alleles. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Apolipoprotein E; Butyrylcholinesterase; Mild cognitive impairment","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E4; Butyrylcholinesterase; Cognition Disorders; Disease Progression; Female; Genetic Screening; Genotype; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; apolipoprotein E; cholinesterase; rivastigmine; adult; aged; allele; Alzheimer disease; apoe gene; article; BCHE K gene; brain size; cognition; cognitive defect; correlation analysis; disease course; female; gene; genetic analysis; genetic association; genetic risk; genotype; hippocampus; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; post hoc analysis; priority journal; risk factor; statistical significance","R.

The studies have not compared brain change patterns in male and female patients with schizophrenia or examined the relation of these patterns to patient subgroups defined by specific symptom domains. Maximum Total Brain Volume (TBVmax), total cranial (TCV), total brain (TBV), sulcal CSF (sCSF), and ventricular (VV) volumes were measured in 66 normal controls (32 females, 34 males), and 85 patients with schizophrenia (21 females, 64 males). Sixty-six patients were categorized as nondeficit and 19 as deficit patients. Patients had smaller TBV and larger VV than normal controls. Patients also showed significant excessive brain volume loss after, but not before, TBVmax was achieved compared with normal controls. Although male patients had larger brain volume loss compared with male normal controls than female patients had compared with female normal controls, there were no significant gender × diagnosis interactions. Male patients with the deficit syndrome, but not those without the deficit syndrome, had significantly larger ventricles than normal controls. There were no other significant deficit/nondeficit differences. The present study suggests that brain volume loss in schizophrenia occurs after TBVmax and that male and female patients and deficit and nondeficit patients with schizophrenia do not demonstrate any differences in the time course of their brain volume reductions. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We describe the procedure we used to create 3D models of the brain from MRI images in patients with Alzheimer disease and then took volumetric measurements of the whole brain parenchyma. After this procedure we correlated the total brain volume measurements in patients with six or fewer years of education with those who had at least 12 years of education. Twenty patients with Alzheimer disease were examined with MRI. All of them had an MMSE score between 21 and 24 and were classified as mild Alzheimer disease. Ten of the patients had at least six years of education and the remaining ten had more than 12 years of education. The examinations were done by using a Siemens Expert Plus system of 1T and the MR images were studied using an automatic algorithm. The MRI images were segmented into grey, white matter and CSF. We then measured the volume of each component and classified those in each patient in relation to years of education. The whole procedure was completed successfully in 20 patients. After the volumetric study of the total brain volume by calculating separately grey matter, white matter and CSF, we classified the patients and made the correlation between those with six or fewer years of education and those with twelve or more years of study. Correlating the whole brain volume measurements of patients with Alzheimer disease and the same MMSE but different levels of education showed that there is no significant difference between the total brain volume of the two groups of our study.","Alzheimer disease; Magnetic resonance; Volumetric study","academic achievement; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; article; brain radiography; brain size; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical article; cognition; computer model; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease classification; disease severity; education; female; gray matter; human; human tissue; image analysis; male; mini mental state examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; three dimensional imaging; volumetry; white matter","P.

Although its role in increasing schizophrenia susceptibility has been conflicting, recent studies suggest the valine allele may contribute to poor cognitive function in schizophrenia. V158M COMT genotype was obtained on 159 schizophrenia patients and 84 healthy controls. The effects of COMT genotype on four measures of working memory/executive functions (Wisconsin Card Sorting, digit span backward, Trail Making and N-back tests) and on MRI frontal brain volumes were examined. Genotype distributions were not significantly different between patients and controls. There were no significant genotype or genotype-by-group effects on any working memory/executive function measures. No genotype or genotype-by- diagnosis interaction effects were found with MRI frontal lobe volumes. Randomization analyses using [15O]H2O positron emission tomography (PET) cerebral blood flow data found Val/Val patients had higher frontal lobe activation than Met/Met patients while performing the one-back task. Overall, these findings do not support a major role for COMT in increasing susceptibility for schizophrenia or in mediating frontal lobe function. Age-related changes and phenotypic heterogeneity of schizophrenia may influence the complex relationships between COMT genotype and cognition. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.

Methods: Forty-five subjects who had been prospectively studied, died, and had an autopsy diagnosis of low, intermediate, or high probability of Alzheimer's disease who had two volumetric head magnetic resonance imaging scans were identified. Compact and total (compact + diffuse) Aβ burden was measured using a computerized image analyzer with software program to detect the proportion of gray matter occupied by Aβ. Visual ratings of Aβ burden were also performed. The boundary shift integral was used to calculate change over time in whole-brain and ventricular volume. All boundary shift integral results were annualized by adjusting for scan interval. Demographics, cognitive measures, clinical diagnoses, apolipoprotein E genotype, neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology, and vascular lesion burden were determined. Results: There was no correlation between compact or total Aβ burden, or visual Aβ ratings, and rates of brain loss or ventricular expansion in all subjects. However, significant correlations were observed between rates of brain loss and age, Braak NFT stage, and change over time in cognitive measures. These features also correlated with rates of ventricular expansion. The rates of brain loss and ventricular expansion were greater in demented compared with nondemented subjects. Interpretation: These findings suggest that rate of brain volume loss is not determined by the amount of insoluble Aβ in the gray matter. © 2007 American Neurological Association Published by Wiley-Liss, Inc., through Wiley Subscription Services.","","Age of Onset; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Protein; Apolipoproteins E; Atrophy; Autopsy; Brain; Disease Progression; Female; Genotype; Humans; Lateral Ventricles; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Senile Plaques; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors; amyloid beta protein; apolipoprotein E; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; article; autopsy; brain atrophy; brain size; brain ventricle; clinical article; cognition; computer assisted tomography; computer program; controlled study; correlation analysis; demography; disease association; female; genotype; gray matter; human; image analysis; male; neurofibrillary tangle; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; probability; vascular lesion; volumetry","K.

While AD pathology is estimated to begin ∼10-15 years prior to the onset of cognitive decline, substantial neuronal loss is present by the time the earliest signs of cognitive impairment appear. Visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1) has demonstrated potential utility as a marker of neuronal injury. Here we investigate CSF VILIP-1 and VILIP-1/amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) ratio as diagnostic and prognostic markers in early AD. Methods: We assessed CSF levels of VILIP-1, tau, phosphorylated-tau181 (p-tau181), and Aβ42 in cognitively normal controls (CNC) (n = 211), individuals with early symptomatic AD (n = 98), and individuals with other dementias (n = 19). Structural magnetic resonance imaging (n = 192) and amyloid imaging with Pittsburgh Compound-B (n = 156) were obtained in subsets of this cohort. Among the CNC cohort, 164 individuals had follow-up annual cognitive assessments for 2-3 years. Results: CSF VILIP-1 levels differentiated individuals with AD from CNC and individuals with other dementias. CSF VILIP-1 levels correlated with CSF tau, p-tau181, and brain volumes in AD. VILIP-1 and VILIP-1/Aβ42 predicted future cognitive impairment in CNC over the follow-up period. Importantly, CSF VILIP-1/Aβ42 predicted future cognitive impairment at least as well as tau/Aβ42 and p-tau181/Aβ42. Interpretation: These findings suggest that CSF VILIP-1 and VILIP-1/Aβ42 offer diagnostic utility for early AD, and can predict future cognitive impairment in cognitively normal individuals similarly to tau and tau/Aβ42, respectively. © 2011 American Neurological Association.","","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biological Markers; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neurocalcin; Prognosis; ROC Curve; tau Proteins; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; biological marker; cholinesterase inhibitor; memantine; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor blocking agent; neuronal calcium sensor; tau protein; unclassified drug; visinin like protein 1; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; article; brain size; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; differential diagnosis; diffuse Lewy body disease; female; follow up; frontotemporal dementia; human; human tissue; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; neurologic examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; predictive value; priority journal; prognosis; progressive supranuclear palsy; protein cerebrospinal fluid level; protein phosphorylation; receiver operating characteristic","D.M.

Twenty-six offspring of chronic schizophrenic patients aged between 8 and 15 years and 23 control children were matched with respect to cranial MRI. Chronic schizophrenic patients were reevaluated with SCID-I to confirm their diagnosis. Parents of children in the control group completed SCL-90-R and were evaluated by clinical interview to exclude any psychotic disorder. The diagnoses of psychiatric disorders in all of the children were established by DSM-IV-based clinical interviews with children and parents. They underwent IQ evaluation by WISC-R and evaluated with cranial MRI. Hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, corpus callosum, frontal, and temporal lobe volumes were measured and compared by using MANCOVA. After covarying whole brain volume, age and gender, statistically significant decrease in the measurements of corpus callosum and hippocampi, and a non-significant trend toward smaller temporal lobes were observed in the high-risk children. The structure of hippocampal formation and corpus callosum were impaired in the children of the schizophrenic patients which suggests a neurodevelopmental abnormality in subjects with genetic high risk for schizophrenia. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Frontotemporal region; High-risk group; MRI; Schizophrenia","Adolescent; Analysis of Variance; Brain Mapping; Child; Child of Impaired Parents; Female; Frontal Lobe; Hippocampus; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Organ Size; Schizophrenia; Temporal Lobe; adolescent; amygdaloid nucleus; article; brain development; brain region; brain size; child; child parent relation; clinical article; controlled study; corpus callosum; developmental disorder; diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders; female; frontal lobe; genetic risk; high risk patient; hippocampus; human; intelligence quotient; interview; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; progeny; schizophrenia; school child; structure analysis; Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders; Symptom Checklist 90; temporal lobe; thalamus; volumetry; Wechsler Intelligence Scale; analysis of variance; brain mapping; child; frontal lobe; histology; image processing; organ size; schizophrenia; temporal lobe","Ş.

Design: Convenience sample in a clinical trial design. Subjects: A total of 804 participants in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative who received MRI scans, cognitive testing, and clinical evaluations at baseline, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up visits. For each scan, WMHs were detected automatically on coregistered sets of T1, proton density, and T2 MRI images using a validated method. Mixed-effects regression models evaluated relationships between risk factors for WMHs, WMHvolume, and change in outcome measures including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADASCog), and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes scores. Covariates in these models included race, sex, years of education, age, apolipoprotein E genotype, baseline clinical diagnosis (cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer disease), cardiovascular risk score, and MRI-based hippocampal and brain volumes. Results: Higher baseline WMH volume was associated with greater subsequent 1-year increase in ADAS-Cog and decrease in MMSE scores. Greater WMH volume at follow-up was associated with greater ADAS-Cog and lower MMSE scores at follow-up. Higher baseline age and cardiovascular risk score and more impaired baseline clinical diagnosis were associated with higher baseline WMH volume. Conclusions: White matter hyperintensity volume predicts 1-year cognitive decline in a relatively healthy convenience sample that was similar to clinical trial samples, and therefore should be considered as a covariate of interest at baseline and longitudinally in future AD treatment trials. ©2010 American Medical Association.

The effect of alcohol consumption in non-clinical alcohol consumers, i.e. subjects not recruited as having alcohol use disorders is less studied. In the present study, we investigated the effects of alcohol consumption, antipsychotic medication and a diagnosis of schizophrenia on variation in brain volumes among patients recruited for having schizophrenia and a group of age and gender matched control subjects. A total of 69 patients with schizophrenia (n = 56), schizoaffective disorder (n = 12) and schizophreniform disorder (n = 1) and 97 control subjects were included. Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) was used to estimate alcohol consumption. In the entire group of patients and controls higher AUDIT score was significantly related to smaller volumes of WM. When ten patients and six control subjects who met lifetime diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorders were excluded only a trend level association between AUDIT score and WM volumes was found. Having a diagnosis of schizophrenia was related to smaller volumes of total, frontal and temporal WM, total and temporal GM, and larger volumes of total, frontal and temporal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A diagnosis of schizophrenia remained a significant factor for smaller WM volumes even when the effect of alcohol consumption was taken into account. Antipsychotic medication was related to larger volumes of temporal CSF. This study demonstrates that alcohol consumption is an important factor for variation in WM volumes, and this effect should be taken into account in all studies evaluating brain volumes from MR images. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We assessed a cohort of 59 PD patients with and without impulse control disorders (PD-ICDs and PD-CNTR) with magnetic resonance imaging and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Thirty-five PD patients presented ICDs according to DSM-IV criteria and Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview. We found areas of significant brain atrophy in the middle and superior frontal gyrus in the whole cohort of 59 PD patients vs. healthy controls but there were no morphometric changes in PD-ICDs vs. PD-CNTR. This was consistent with cognitive findings of relatively preserved function in PD-ICDs with the exception for slower performance in the Trail Making Test B-A suggesting difficulties to maintain goal-directed tasks and suppress irrelevant responses. Voxel Based Morphometric regression analysis (VBM) carried out using TMTB-A as independent factor showed a negative gray matter correlation between high TMTB-A scores and left middle frontal cortex, right posterior cingulate area, anterior cingulate and supplementary motor area bilaterally. Our results suggest that PD is characterized by an overall loss of gray matter in pre-frontal regions. However, the contribution of these changes to the development of ICDs is marginal. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Impulse control disorders; MRI; Neuropsychology; Parkinson's disease; Trail Making Test; Voxel-based morphometry","Aged; Behavioral Symptoms; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cognition Disorders; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Parkinson Disease; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Statistics, Nonparametric; amantadine; apomorphine; entacapone; levodopa; pramipexole; ropinirole; rotigotine; selegiline; tolcapone; adult; aged; anterior cingulate; article; behavior disorder; binge eating disorder; brain atrophy; brain function; brain size; cingulate gyrus; cognitive defect; cohort analysis; collecting disorder; compulsive shopping; controlled study; diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders; disease association; female; frontal cortex; gray matter; human; hypersexuality; impulse control disorder; international classification of diseases; major clinical study; male; mental performance; middle frontal gyrus; morphometrics; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; pathological gambling; priority journal; psychologic test; punding; superior frontal gyrus; voxel based morphometry","A.

Variations in individual head size may be corrected by normalization with use of a total intracranial volume (TIV) measurement. The TIV also may be used to correct for voxel size fluctuations in serial studies. The TIV should be measured from the same images used for structural volumetry, usually T1-weighted imaging. The objectives were to show that normalization with TIV reduces interindividual variation, to develop and validate a simple protocol for measuring TIV from T1-weighted MR images, and to apply TIV normalization to serial brain measures in controls and subjects with Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: We measured TIV with a semiautomated segmentation technique on T1- and T2-weighted MR images in 55 controls, 10 AD patients, and two persons at risk of familial AD. Whole-brain volumes also were measured and normalized with TIVs. RESULTS: The TIV normalization of cross-sectional brain volumes significantly reduced interindividual variation; the coefficient of variation (CV) was reduced from 10.0% to 6.0% in controls (P < .001). The TIVs measured on T1-weighted images had low variability (CV, 0.16%) and did not differ significantly from those measured on T2-weighted images (P = .16). The TIV normalization of serial brain-volume measurements reduced interimage differences caused by voxel-scaling variations (CV reduced from 1.3% to 0.5%, P = .002) in 10 controls and five AD patients. CONCLUSION: Structural volumes should be normalized with a TIV, measured cross-sectionally, to reduce interindividual variation, and longitudinally with a concurrent measurement, to reduce subtle interimage differences. This may have important implications in progression studies.","","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Female; Genetic Screening; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Reference Values; Time Factors; Alzheimer disease; brain atrophy; brain size; clinical article; conference paper; controlled study; disease course; head; high risk patient; human; longitudinal study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observer variation; quantitative diagnosis; skull; standardization; validation process; volumetry","","","","01956108","","AAJND","11559495","English","Am.

High-dimensional pattern classification methods have been reported to have the capacity to determine subtle and spatially complex structural patterns that distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy control subjects using standard magnetic resonance imaging. This study investigates whether such endophenotypic patterns are found in FM via similar image analysis approaches. Methods: A high-dimensional pattern classifier was constructed from a group of 69 patients and 79 control subjects, via an analysis that identified a subtle and spatially complex pattern of reduced brain volumes. The constructed classifier was applied to examine brain structure of 30 FM. Results: The classifier indicated that FM had highly overlapping structural profiles with those of patients. Moreover, an orbitofrontal region of relatively increased white matter was found to contribute significantly to the classification, indicating that white matter alterations, along with reductions of gray matter volumes, might be present in patients and unaffected FM. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that high-dimensional pattern classification can identify complex and subtle structural endophenotypes that are shared by probands and their unaffected FM. © 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.","Classification; high-dimensional pattern; schizophrenia; structural MRI; unaffected family member","Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Case-Control Studies; Family Health; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Schizophrenia; Sex Factors; adult; article; brain; brain region; brain size; classification; cluster analysis; controlled study; family study; female; gray matter; human; image analysis; major clinical study; male; orbital cortex; phenotype; priority journal; schizophrenia; scoring system; white matter","C.

Design: Subjects were recruited into this prospective cohort study and followed for incident cognitive decline for mean (SD) 6.0 (4.1) years. Magnetic resonance imaging dual-echo sequences, obtained at baseline, were used to determine the volume of WMH and the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), the proportion of the intracranial cavity occupied by brain. White matter hyperintensity volume was analyzed as the percentage of intracranial volume (WMHr); ""high WMH""was defined as a WMHr more than 1 SD above the mean. Setting: General community. Patients: Volunteer sample consisting of 67 subjects with normal cognition and 156 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Main Outcome Measures: Time to diagnosis of MCI (among those with normal cognition at baseline) or time to diagnosis of dementia, either all-cause or probable Alzheimer disease (AD) (among those with MCI at baseline). Cox proportional hazards models were used for multivariable analysis. Results: High WMH was a predictor of progression from normal to MCI (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 3.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-8.17; P=.01) but not conversion from MCI to all-cause dementia. Conversely, BPF did not predict progression from normal to MCI but did predict conversion to dementia (adjusted HR, 1.10 for each 1% decrease in BPF; 95% CI, 1.02-1.19; P=.02). When conversion to AD dementia was considered as the outcome, BPF was likewise a predictor (adjusted HR, 1.16 for each 1% decrease in BPF; 95% CI, 1.08-1.24; P<.001), but high WMH was not. Past tobacco smoking was associated with both progression from normal to MCI (adjusted HR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.12-6.55; P=.03) and conversion to all-cause dementia (adjusted HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.13-3.82; P=.02), but not AD dementia. Conclusions: These findings suggest that WMH are associated with the risk of progressing from normal to MCI. In persons whose cognitive abilities are already impaired, BPF predicts the conversion to dementia. ©2008 American Medical Association.

We examined relationships between a previously implicated DTNBP1 risk variant [P1578] and global and segmented brain tissue volumes and regional cortical thickness in schizophrenia (n = 62; 24 risk carriers) and healthy subjects (n = 42; 11 risk carriers), across ethnic groups and within Caucasians. Schizophrenia patients showed similar brain volumes, but significantly reduced brain-size adjusted gray matter and CSF volumes and cortical thinning in a widespread neocortical distribution compared to controls. DTNBP1 risk was found associated with reduced brain volume, but not with tissue subcompartments. Cortical thickness, which was weakly associated with brain size, showed regional variations in association with genetic risk, although effects were dominated by highly significant genotype by diagnosis interactions over broad areas of cortex. Risk status was found associated with regional cortical thinning in patients, particularly in temporal networks, but with thickness increases in controls. DTNBP1 effects for brain volume and cortical thickness appear driven by different neurobiological processes. Smaller brain volumes observed in risk carriers may relate to previously reported DTNBP1/cognitive function relationships irrespective of diagnosis. Regional cortical thinning in patient, but not in control risk carriers, may suggest that DTNBP1 interacts with other schizophrenia-related risk factors to affect laminar thickness. Alternatively, DTNBP1 may influence neural processes for which individuals with thicker cortex are less vulnerable. Although DTNBP1 relates to cortical thinning in schizophrenia, morphological changes in the disorder are influenced by additional genetic and/or environmental factors. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Brain structure; Cortical thickness; Dysbindin; Genetic marker; Gray matter; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Morphology; Polymorphism","Adult; Brain Mapping; Carrier Proteins; Cerebral Cortex; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Models, Neurological; Phenotype; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Risk Factors; Schizophrenia; Young Adult; dysbindin; adult; article; brain atrophy; brain mapping; brain size; cerebrospinal fluid; controlled study; ethnic group; female; genetic risk; genotype phenotype correlation; heterozygote; human; major clinical study; male; neocortex; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phenotype; priority journal; risk assessment; schizophrenia","K.

Methods: Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were acquired one year apart in subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson disease dementia (PDD), Alzheimer disease (AD), and also healthy elderly comparison subjects. WMH volume was quantified using an automated technique. Results: Baseline WMH (as a percent of brain volume) was significantly greater compared with healthy subjects (N = 33, geometric mean WMH: 0.4%) in subjects with AD (N = 23 [1.3%], analysts of variance post hoc p <0.001) but not PDD (N = 13 [0.6%]) or DLB (N = 14 [0.4%]). Increase in WMH volume (as a percent of brain volume) was not significantly different (Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.4) between groups (AD median change: 0.08%; DLB: 0.025%; PDD: 0.07%, healthy: 0.02%). Severity of baseline WMH, rather than diagnosis or severity of dementia, was a significant predictor of lesion progression. Rate of change of WMH had no association with change in global cognitive performance. Conclusions: Significant WMH progression occurs in degenerative dementias with rates influenced by severity of lesions at baseline rather than dementia type or cognitive decline. © 2006 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.","Dementia; MRI; White matter hyperintensities","aged; aging; Alzheimer disease; article; automation; brain size; cognition; cognitive defect; controlled study; degenerative disease; diagnostic value; differential diagnosis; diffuse Lewy body disease; disease course; disease severity; female; fluid attenuated inversion recovery image analysis; geometry; human; image analysis; Kruskal Wallis test; Lewy body; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; neuroanatomy; neuropathology; Parkinson disease; prospective study; quantitative analysis; white matter; white matter hyperintensity","J.T.

We compared single variables and combinations regarding their power for optimizing diagnostic accuracy.Methods: Twelve cognitively normal elderly controls (CN), 30 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 15 with mild AD were examined by structural and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in single sessions at 1.5 Tesla. rVOLs were measured by manual volumetry, and rCBFs were calculated with a ROI-based co-localization technique.Results: Applying single MRI variables for the differentiation of AD versus CN, the area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCCs) was highest for rVOL variables (maximum of 0.972 for right amygdala). A composite marker selected and weighted by logistic regression containing left amygdalar rCBF, left hippocampal and right amygdalar rVOLs gave a diagnostic accuracy for AD versus CN of 100%. Internal cross-validation revealed a reliability of 88.9%.Conclusions: Whilst external revalidation is mandatory employing a naturalistic sample containing disease controls, our phase I/II findings demonstrate that deducing composite markers from multimodal MRI acquisitions can optimize diagnostic accuracy for AD. © 2010 The Author(s).

Methods: 23 patients with (AD and 23 sex, age, and educational background-matched normal controls (NC group) underwent three-dimensional MRI to measure the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex (EC), perirhinal cortex (PC), cornu temporale, and uncus distance in the baseline survey. Two years later 10 AD patients and 11 normal controls underwent 3-D MRI once again in the follow-up survey. Results: The baseline survey showed that the levels of uncus distance and total temporal horn volume of the ADS patients were 11 ± 4 and 1.21 ± 1.00 respectively, both significantly higher than those of the NC group (7 ± 3 and 0.59 ± 0.54 respectively, P <0.01, P <0.05), and the levels of total entorhinal cortex volume, total perirhinal cortex volume, and total hippocampus volume were 2.52 ± 0.86, 2.19 ± 0.62, and 3.23 ± 0.75 respectively, all significantly lower than those of the BC group (3.67 ± 0.54, 3.39 ± 0.51, and 3.98 ± 0.38, all P <0.01). The levels of uncus distance and total temporal horn volume of the AD patients during the follow-up survey were 11 ± 4 and 1.21 ± 1.00 respectively, both significantly higher than those of the NC group (7 ± 3 and 0.59 ± 0.54 respectively, both P <0.05); and the total entorhinal cortex volume, total perirhinal cortex volume, and total hippocampus volume of the AD patients during the follow-up survey were. 1.79 ± 0.56, 1.77 ± 0.59, and 2.80 ± 0.80 respectively, all significantly lower than those of the NC group (2.76 ± 0.50, 2.76 ± 0.41, and 3.59 ± 0.38 respectively, all P <0.01). Conclusion: The AD patients have more remarkable atrophy of entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and have obvious extension of cornu temporale and uncus distance in comparison with the normal controls. The shrinkage rate of hippocampus can be used as a marker for the diagnosis and progress of AD.","Alzheimer's disease; Brain; MRI; Volume","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amygdala; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Cerebral Cortex; Entorhinal Cortex; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; amygdaloid nucleus; article; brain atrophy; brain cortex; brain size; case control study; clinical article; controlled study; entorhinal cortex; female; follow up; hippocampus; human; image reconstruction; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; statistical significance; three dimensional imaging","Department of Psychogeriatrics, Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200030, China; email: xiaosfc@online.sh.cn","","","03762491","","","18754434","Chinese","Nat.

We used hierarchical modelling to assess how hippocampal and whole-brain volumes change as familial Alzheimer's disease progresses from the presymptomatic stage through to diagnosis. Methods: Nine mutation carriers had serial clinical assessments and volumetric MRI scans (41 scans: range 3-8 per patient) at different clinical stages (presymptomatic, mild cognitive impairment, or clinical Alzheimer's disease). 25 healthy controls had serial scanning (54 scans: range 2-4 per patient) for comparison. We measured whole brain and total hippocampal volumes using semi-automated techniques, and adjusted for total intracranial volume. Hierarchical models were developed to estimate differences in volume and atrophy rate between mutation carriers and controls in relation to when the disease was clinically diagnosed. Findings: Mutation carriers had significantly increased hippocampal and whole-brain atrophy rates compared with controls and these differences increased with time. Differences in hippocampal and whole-brain atrophy rates between controls and mutation carriers were evident 5·5 and 3·5 years, respectively, before diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. At a cross-sectional level, differences in mean hippocampal volume between mutation carriers and controls became significant 3 years before clinical diagnosis, whereas differences in mean brain volumes became significant only 1 year before diagnosis. Interpretation: Structural changes can be seen on MRI scans that predate the clinical onset of familial Alzheimer's disease. Longitudinal measures of atrophy rates can identify differences between mutation carriers and controls 2-3 years earlier than cross-sectional volumetric measures. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Morphometric studies on the corpus callosum (CC) in schizophrenia have yielded contradictory results. The aim of the present study was to investigate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities of the CC in first-episode patients with schizophrenic psychoses. Method. We assessed volumetric MRI in 31 patients with diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) and a maximum exposure to neuroleptics of 2 weeks. As a control group, 12 healthy age- and sex-matched individuals were included in the study. A whole body scanner at 1.5 Tesla was used to obtain 3D T1 - and T2-weighted MR datasets. The data were evaluated semi-automatically (intracranial volume, total brain volume) and manually (CC) with the software NMRwin. Results. Patients had smaller CC and CC subdivisions than controls. Schizophrenic and unaffected women exhibited larger total CC and rostral subdivisions than men in both groups. Handedness did not exert an influence. Conclusions. Our findings are in line with other in vivo morphometric studies on the CC in schizophrenia. The larger CC area in women may reflect general gender-related differences in CC size as described in healthy individuals.","","Adult; Corpus Callosum; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Schizophrenia; Sex Factors; neuroleptic agent; adult; article; brain size; clinical article; computer program; controlled study; corpus callosum; data analysis; device; drug exposure; female; gender; handedness; human; image analysis; in vivo study; male; morphometrics; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; psychosis; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; schizophreniform disorder; volumetry; whole body scanner; whole body scintiscanning","","","","00332917","","PSMDC","12946086","English","Psychol.

Methods: Ninety-seven SNPs were genotyped in 243 subjects from a longitudinal study of healthy aging. Subjects who received a diagnosis of cognitive impairment (CI) at any study visit (before their most recent visit) and had DNA in the study's DNA bank were included. Progression of AD was defined as the duration from onset of CI to diagnosis of AD. Association of each of the 97 SNPs with AD progression was tested via Cox model. Those SNPs meeting a criterion of nominal significance (P < 0.05) for association with AD progression were reassessed to account for multiple testing by repeating the marker selection process in 10,000 random permutations. Next, the association between the one SNP that survived the multiple-testing adjustment and brain volume was determined by multiple regression analysis in a subgroup of subjects for whom magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI)-derived brain-volume data were available. Brain volumes were adjusted for age at MRI, gender, and time from MRI to onset of CI. Results: The minor allele of rs1468063 in the FAS gene, which is member 6 of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, was significantly associated with faster AD progression after adjustment for multiple testing (Ppermutation = 0.049). The same allele in rs1468063 was associated with smaller brain volumes and larger ventricular volumes (P = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). Conclusions: The FAS gene, which plays a role in apoptosis, may be associated with AD by modulating the apoptosis and neuronal loss secondary to AD neuropathology.","Alzheimer's disease; Brain volume; FAS; Genetics; MRI","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Antigens, CD95; Apoptosis; Atrophy; Brain; Disease Progression; DNA Mutational Analysis; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Testing; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nerve Degeneration; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Regression Analysis; DNA; Fas antigen; aged; aging; allele; Alzheimer disease; article; brain size; cognitive defect; controlled study; disease course; female; genetic association; genotype; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; onset age; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism","D.

The challenge lies in the definition of those vascular components being responsible for the cognitive-behavioural decline of elderly patients. We advocate the use of longitudinal brain MRI studies to establish what type and extent of lesion progression parallels cognitive deterioration in elderly patients who often present with a plethora of diffuse and focal brain abnormalities that may or may not contribute to their cognitive phenotype. So far, a temporal relationship between lesion progression and cognitive decline has been established only for two types of ""vascular"" abnormalities. The most convincing evidence exists for confluent white matter lesions, less, but clearly supportive data are available for lacunes. All other brain abnormalities including microbleeds, loss of brain volume due to vascular processes or ultrastructural brain changes as seen with new imaging techniques need to be further explored in terms of their pathological correlates, rates of progression and their relationship to cognitive functioning. Such data are the pre-requisite to further develop the currently vague concept of VCI to a clearly defined diagnostic entity. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and shape analyses of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, we investigated structural brain differences between groups of healthy subjects, stratified by subsequent diagnoses of MCI or AD during a 10-year follow-up. Images taken at baseline, at least 4 years before any cognitive symptoms, showed that subjects with future cognitive impairment (preclinical AD and MCI) had reduced brain volume in medial temporal lobes, posterior cingulate/precuneus, and orbitofrontal cortex, compared with matched subjects who remained cognitively healthy for 10 years (HC). For only those subjects later diagnosed as AD, significantly greater atrophy at baseline was detected in the right medial temporal lobe, which was also confirmed by shape analysis of the right hippocampus in these subjects. Our results demonstrate that structural brain changes occur years before clinical cognitive decline in AD and are localized to regions affected by AD neuropathology. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Alzheimer's disease (AD); Mild cognitive impairment (MCI); Preclinical AD; Structural MRI; Voxel-based morphometry (VBM)","aged; Alzheimer disease; article; brain atrophy; brain size; cingulate gyrus; cognitive defect; controlled study; female; follow up; hippocampus; human; image analysis; major clinical study; male; mild cognitive impairment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; orbital cortex; precuneus; priority journal; temporal lobe; voxel based morphometry","G.

Total brain and lobar volumes and those of gray matter (GM), white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured in 92 patients with a FEP and in 94 controls, matched for age, gender, and years of education. Male patients (n = 64) showed several significant differences when compared with controls (n = 61). GM volume in male patients was reduced in the whole brain and in frontal and parietal lobes compared with controls. Total CSF volume and frontal, temporal, and right parietal CSF volumes were also increased in male patients. Within patients, those with a further diagnosis of ""schizophrenia"" or ""other psychosis"" showed a pattern similar to the group of all patients relative to controls. However, bipolar patients showed fewer differences relative to controls. In female patients, only the schizophrenia group showed differences relative to controls, in frontal CSF. GM deficit in male patients with a first episode correlated with negative symptoms. Our study suggests that at least part of the GM deficit in children and adolescent-onset schizophrenia and in other psychosis occurs before onset of the first positive symptoms and that, contrary to what has been shown in children-onset schizophrenia, frontal GM deficits are probably present from the first appearance of positive symptoms in children and adolescents. © The Author 2010.

MRI scans of 37 patients with AD and 37 age-matched cognitively normal elderly individuals, as well as 12 patients with FTD and 12 age-matched cognitively normal elderly individuals, were analyzed using voxel-based analysis and high-dimensional pattern classification. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of spatial patterns of regional brain atrophy found to be characteristic of AD and FTD were determined via cross-validation and via split-sample methods. Complex spatial patterns of relatively reduced brain volumes were identified, including temporal, orbitofrontal, parietal and cingulate regions, which were predominantly characteristic of either AD or FTD. These patterns provided 100% diagnostic accuracy, when used to separate AD or FTD from healthy controls. The ability to correctly distinguish AD from FTD averaged 84.3%. All estimates of diagnostic accuracy were determined via cross-validation. In conclusion, AD- and FTD-specific patterns of brain atrophy can be detected with high accuracy using high-dimensional pattern classification of MRI scans obtained in a typical clinical setting. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.","Alzheimer's disease (26); Frontotemporal dementia (29); Volumetric MRI (130)","Age of Onset; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dementia; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; adult; Alzheimer disease; article; brain atrophy; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; female; frontotemporal dementia; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; volumetry","C.

However, whether these abnormalities progressively worsen during the subsequent course of the disorder remains unresolved. Methods: To study the longitudinal progression of structural brain abnormalities, high-resolution multispectral magnetic resonance images obtained on 73 recent-onset schizophrenic patients and 23 controls were analyzed using state-of-the-art, well-validated, and highly reliable neuroimaging tools. The mean duration between initial and follow-up MRIs was 3 years. Repeated-measures analysis of covariance was carried out to determine (1) whether brain volume changes differed between patients and controls and (2) the significance of regional brain changes on functional outcome in schizophrenia. Results: We found accelerated enlargement in cortical sulcal cerebrospinal fluid spaces early in the course of schizophrenia. Instead of the usual trajectory of volume enlargement, patients showed progressive reduction in frontal lobe white matter volume. A reciprocal increase in frontal lobe cerebrospinal fluid volume also occurred at a more rapid rate in patients than in controls. In keeping with most of our a priori hypotheses, patients with poor outcome had greater lateral ventricular enlargement over time than patients with good outcome. Progressive decrement in frontal lobe white matter volume and enlargement in frontal lobe cerebrospinal fluid volume were associated with greater negative symptom severity. Reductions in frontal lobe gray and white matter volumes correlated with poorer executive functioning. Conclusions: There are ongoing changes in the brains of schizophrenic patients during the initial years after diagnosis despite ongoing antipsychotic drug treatment. These progressive changes seem to be most evident in the frontal lobes and to correlate with functional impairment. Disruptions in neurodevelopment or neural plasticity may act alone or in combination to bring about these progressive brain deficits in schizophrenia.","","Adult; Age of Onset; Antipsychotic Agents; Brain; Cerebral Ventricles; Disease Progression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuronal Plasticity; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Schizophrenia; Temporal Lobe; neuroleptic agent; adolescent; adult; article; brain cortex; brain disease; brain function; cerebrospinal fluid; cerebrospinal fluid level; controlled study; disease association; disease course; female; frontal lobe; functional assessment; functional disease; gray matter; human; human tissue; hypertrophy; lateral brain ventricle; major clinical study; male; nerve cell differentiation; nerve cell plasticity; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; schizophrenia; white matter","B.-C.

Design: Longitudinal study from May 22, 1985, through October 15, 2008. Setting: Washington University Alzheimer Disease Research Center. Participants: A total of 135 individuals aged 65 to 88 years with a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0. Main Outcome Measures: The relations between mean cortical carbon 11 (11C)-labeled Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) binding potential values, proportional to the density of fibrillar Aβ binding sites in the brain, concurrent regional brain volumes as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, and both concurrent and longitudinal cognitive performance in multiple domains. Results: Elevated cerebral Aβ levels, in some cases comparable to those seen in individuals with Alzheimer disease, were observed in 29 participants, who also had smaller regional volumes in the hippocampus, temporal neocortex, anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate. Concurrent cognitive performance was unrelated to Aβ levels but was related to regional brain volumes with the exception of the caudate. Longitudinal cognitive decline in episodic and working memory and visuospatial ability was associated with elevated Aβ levels and decreased hippocampal volume. Conclusion: The in vivo measure of cerebral amyloidosis known as [ 11C]PiB is associated with cross-sectional regionally specific brain atrophy and longitudinal cognitive decline in multiple cognitive domains that occur before the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. These findings contribute to the understanding of the cognitive and structural consequences of Aβ levels in cognitively healthy older adults. ©2009 American Medical Association.","","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Protein; Aniline Compounds; Brain; Carbon Radioisotopes; Cerebral Cortex; Cognition Disorders; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Organ Size; Peptide Fragments; Protein Binding; Thiazoles; amyloid beta protein; carbon 11; contrast medium; pittsburgh compund b; unclassified drug; aged; article; brain cortex; brain size; cingulate gyrus; controlled study; female; hippocampus; human; human experiment; male; mental deterioration; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; rating scale; temporal cortex","J.

In this study, we tested whether neuropsychological function-brain structure relationships differed as a function of illness stage. In addition, we tested whether these relationships differed between older and young healthy controls. Function-structure relationships were examined in 35 first-episode patients (31 with schizophrenia, 4 with schizoaffective disorder), 54 chronic schizophrenia patients, 21 older healthy controls and 20 young healthy controls. MRI volumes of frontal and temporal lobe structures, as well as the whole brain, were estimated using a region-of-interest approach. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed between the MRI and neuropsychological measures. Stronger relationships of immediate memory-total prefrontal cortex (PFC) volume in chronic than first-episode patients, and in older than young controls were observed. The abstract reasoning (WCST perseverative errors)-total temporal lobe volume relationship was stronger in older than young controls. These function-structure relationships appeared unexplained by whole brain volume or age in chronic patients. A similar dissociation between young and older subjects of both healthy and patient groups suggests that a 'bigger-is-better' relationship style is present in older individuals regardless of a diagnosis of schizophrenia. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Structural MRI studies and functional studies using FDG-PET and brain perfusion SPECT are widely used in diagnosis of AD. Outstanding progress in the diagnostic accuracy of these neuroimaging modalities has been obtained using statistical analysis on a voxel-by-voxel basis after spatial normalization of individual scans to a standardized brain-volume template instead of visual inspection or a conventional region of interest technique. In a very early stage of AD, this statistical approach revealed gray matter loss in medial temporal areas prominently in the entorhinal cortex and hypometabolism or hypoperfusion in the posterior cingulate cortex and precunei. These two findings might be related in view of anatomical knowledge that the regions are linked through the circuit of Papez. This statistical approach also offers a predictive value of conversion from MCI to AD and accurate evaluation of therapeutic effects on brain metabolism or perfusion. This development in functional and structural imaging might be an important surrogate marker for trials of disease-modifying agents. © 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2007 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society.","Alzheimer's disease; MRI; PET; SPECT","Alzheimer disease; brain function; cognitive defect; computer assisted diagnosis; computer program; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; differential diagnosis; disease course; early diagnosis; functional anatomy; geriatric assessment; human; image analysis; imaging system; neuroimaging; neuropathology; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathological anatomy; positron emission tomography; priority journal; review; risk factor; single photon emission computer tomography","H.

School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States","Background: Schizophrenia and alcoholism are characterized by brain volume abnormalities. Despite the frequent comorbidity of these conditions, the potentially compounded effects of comorbidity on brain structure have seldom been rigorously assessed. Methods: To determine the compounding effect of schizophrenia and alcoholism on regional brain volumes, we performed retrospective quantitative analysis of magnetic resonance images from men who participated in research protocols at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, Calif. Participants were selected on the basis of diagnostic criteria, yielding 4 comparison groups: 35 men comorbid for DSM-III-R schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and lifetime alcohol abuse or dependence; 64 men with DSM-III-R schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; 62 men with Research Diagnostic Criteria alcoholism; and 62 healthy men screened to exclude any Axis I diagnosis or heavy alcohol use. The comorbid group matched the schizophrenia group on age and illness severity but was younger and drank 5 times less alcohol in their lifetimes than the alcoholism group. Gray and white matter volumes from 6 cortical regions were expressed as age- and head size-corrected z scores and were subjected to multivariate profile analyses. Results: Gray matter volume deficits were present in all 3 patient groups but were greatest in the comorbid group. In the comorbid group, the most prominent volume deficits were in the prefrontal and anterior superior temporal regions. Conclusions: Despite lower alcohol exposure than in pure alcoholism, the comorbidity of schizophrenia with alcoholism has a particularly profound effect on prefrontal gray matter volume, compounding the prominent prefrontal deficits present independently in schizophrenia and alcoholism.","","Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; Brain; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; Comorbidity; Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry); Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Prefrontal Cortex; Schizophrenia; Substance-Related Disorders; Temporal Lobe; adult; alcohol abuse; alcoholism; analysis of variance; article; brain size; comorbidity; controlled study; correlation analysis; demography; diagnostic imaging; disease severity; gray matter; human; image processing; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prefrontal cortex; quantitative analysis; retrospective study; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; scoring system; statistical analysis; substance abuse; temporal lobe","D.H.

Methods: We used magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain volume in 24 psychotic youth (13 male, 11 female) with EOSS (n = 12) or EOMD (n = 12) and 17 healthy controls (10 male, 7 female). We measured the volume of grey and white matter using an automated segmentation program. Results: After adjustment for age and intracranial volume, whole brain volume was lower in the EOSS patients than in the healthy controls (p = 0.001) and EOMD patients (p = 0.002). The EOSS patients had a deficit in grey matter volume (p = 0.005), especially in the frontal (p = 0.003) and parietal (p = 0.006) lobes, with no significant differences in white matter volume. Limitations: The main limitations of our study were its small sample size and the inclusion of patients with depression and mania in the affective group. Conclusion: Adolescents with EOSS have grey matter deficits compared with healthy controls and psychotic adolescents with EOMD. Our results suggest that grey matter deficits are not generally associated with psychosis but may be specifically associated with schizophrenia. Larger studies with consistent methods are needed to reconcile the contradictory findings among imaging studies involving psychotic youth. © 2010 Canadian Medical Association.","","Adolescent; Brain; Child; Female; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mood Disorders; Parietal Lobe; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; article; brain size; child; clinical article; controlled study; depression; female; frontal lobe; gray matter; human; male; mania; mood disorder; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; onset age; parietal lobe; schizophrenia; school child; white matter; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; mood disorder; pathology; psychological rating scale; psychosis; schizophrenia; young adult","L.

Cortical, subcortical and ventricular volume measures were correlated with global indices of motor disability and cognitive disturbance. All MRI measures, including hippocampal volume, were preserved in Parkinson's disease. Patients with PSP could be distinguished from both Parkinson's disease and controls by whole brain volume loss, ventricular dilatation and disproportionate atrophy of the frontal cortex. Caudate nucleus volume loss additionally differentiated PSP from controls, but was modest in severity and proportionate to whole brain volume loss. The present study identifies disease-specific differences in the topography of brain atrophy between PSP and Parkinson's disease, and has potential implications for the in vivo radiological differentiation of these two disorders. In PSP, the variance in frontal grey matter volume related to measures of behavioural disturbance, confirming the use of behavioural tests for ante-mortem case differentiation and suggesting that intrinsic cortical deficits contribute to these clinical disturbances.","Frontal cortex; Parkinson's disease; Progressive supranuclear palsy; Volumetric MRI","aged; article; behavior; behavior disorder; brain atrophy; brain cortex; brain region; brain size; brain ventricle; brain ventricle dilatation; clinical article; clinical feature; cognitive defect; controlled study; correlation analysis; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; disease severity; female; gray matter; hippocampus; human; male; motor dysfunction; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; priority journal; progressive supranuclear palsy; three dimensional imaging; topography; volumetry","N.J.

It reports results obtained from a large N, collected and analyzed by the same laboratory over a multiyear period, with visually guided MRI segmentation being the primary initial analytic tool.Methods: Intracerebral volume (ICV), total brain volume (TBV), ventricular volume (VV), ventricular/brain ratio (VBR), and TBV/ICV ratios were calculated from a total of 224 subject MRIs collected over a period of 13 years. Subject groups included controls (C, N = 89), and patients with schizophrenia (SZ, N = 58), bipolar disorder (BD, N = 51), and schizoaffective disorder (SAD, N = 26).Results: ICV, TBV, and VV measures compared favorably with values obtained by other research groups, but in this study did not differ significantly between groups. TBV/ICV ratios were significantly decreased, and VBR increased, in the SZ and BD groups compared to the C group. The SAD group did not differ from C on any measure.Conclusions: In this study TBV/ICV and VBR ratios separated SZ and BD patients from controls. Of interest however, SAD patients did not differ from controls on these measures. The findings suggest that the gross measure of TBV may not reliably differ in the major mental illnesses to a degree useful in diagnosis, likely due to the intrinsic variability of the measures in question; the differences in VBR appear more robust across studies. Differences in some of these findings compared to earlier reports from several laboratories finding significant differences between groups in VV and TBV may relate to phenomenological drift, differences in analytic techniques, and possibly the ""file drawer problem"". © 2010 Reite et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Adult; Age Factors; Analysis of Variance; Atrophy; Bipolar Disorder; Brain; Cerebral Ventricles; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Disorders; Organ Size; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia; Sex Factors; adult; article; bipolar disorder; brain size; brain ventricle; controlled study; disease association; female; human; major clinical study; male; mental disease; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; United States; age; analysis of variance; atrophy; bipolar disorder; brain; brain ventricle; comparative study; histology; image processing; longitudinal study; mental disease; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; psychosis; schizophrenia; sex difference; statistics","M.

Here we use DTI to investigate the difference between male and female white matter tracts in healthy older participants (24 women, 16 men) and participants with mild cognitive impairment (21 women, 12 men). Differences between control and MCI participants were found in fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusion (DR), axial diffusion (DA) and mean diffusion (MD). A significant main effect of sex was also reported for FA, MD and DR indices, with male control and male MCI participants having significantly more microstructural damage than their female counterparts. There was no sex by diagnosis interaction. Male MCIs also had significantly less normalised grey matter (GM) volume than female MCIs. However, in terms of absolute brain volume, male controls had significantly more brain volume than female controls. Normalised GM and WM volumes were found to decrease significantly with age with no age by sex interaction. Overall, these data suggest that the same degree of cognitive impairment is associated with greater structural damage in men compared with women. © 2012 O'Dwyer et al.","","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Organ Size; Sex Characteristics; Sex Factors; adult; aged; aging; article; brain damage; brain region; brain size; clinical article; controlled study; diffusion tensor imaging; disease association; disease severity; female; fractional anisotropy; gray matter; human; image analysis; image processing; male; mild cognitive impairment; nerve tract; neuroimaging; sex difference; white matter; Alzheimer disease; brain; clinical trial; middle aged; multicenter study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathophysiology; radiography; sexual development","L.

We predicted that FEP subjects would show longitudinal reductions in fronto-temporal gray- and white-matter volumes compared with controls. Furthermore, we expected groups to be differentiated by diagnosis-related reductions. Methods: Twenty-five schizophrenia and 8 bipolar disorder FEP patients underwent a structural MRI scan at first presentation and 2 years later. Matched healthy subjects (n = 22) underwent a single identical scan. Results: At initial presentation FEP subjects had significantly less gray- and white-matter than healthy subjects. Diagnostic dissociations were revealed both at first presentation and at follow-up. In schizophrenia patients, gray-matter deficits were observed in lateral and medial frontal regions and in bilateral posterior temporal lobe regions, with additional extensive losses over time in lateral fronto-temporal regions and left anterior cingulate gyrus. By contrast, gray matter deficit in bipolar patients was localized to bilateral inferior temporal gyri with additional loss over time observed only in the anterior cingulate cortex. Conclusions: The results are consistent with a dual process model of psychosis, in which the diagnosis-related gray matter loss is determined by neurodevelopmental gray-matter volumetric differences which predate symptom onset, and diagnosis-related neurodegenerative gray-matter loss over time. © 2005 Society of Biological Psychiatry.","Bipolar disorder; First episode psychosis; Gray matter; Longitudinal; Schizophrenia; Voxel based morphometry; White matter","Adolescent; Adult; Bipolar Disorder; Brain; Brain Mapping; Disease Progression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Models, Neurological; Positron-Emission Tomography; Schizophrenia; adolescent; adult; article; bipolar disorder; brain atrophy; brain size; cingulate gyrus; clinical article; controlled study; diagnosis related group; disease course; female; follow up; frontal lobe; gray matter; human; longitudinal study; male; nerve degeneration; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prediction; priority journal; psychosis; schizophrenia; temporal lobe; white matter","A.W.F.

We used multiple MRI scans to measure progression of cerebral atrophy in 12 patients with Alzheimer's disease who were followed up from a presymptomatic stage through to moderately severe dementia. Analysis with hierarchical regression models with quadratic terms in time provided evidence of increasing yearly percentage losses in brain volume. At the time when patients were judged to have mild dementia (mini-mental state examination score MMSE=23), mean yearly loss of brain volume was 2·8% (95% CI 2·3-3·3), which rose by 0·32% per year (0· 15-0·50). Our findings reinforce the need for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease.","","adult; Alzheimer disease; article; brain atrophy; brain region; brain size; clinical article; controlled study; dementia; disease course; disease severity; female; human; longitudinal study; male; mini mental state examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; onset age; priority journal; regression analysis","D.

We included comparisons to subjects with aMCI who did not progress (labeled aMCI-S) and also to cognitively normal elderly subjects (CN). METHODS: We studied 46 subjects with aMCI who progressed to AD (labeled aMCI-P), 46 CN, and 23 aMCI-S. All subjects must have had three or more serial MRI scans. Rates of brain shrinkage and ventricular expansion were measured across all available serial MRI scans in each subject. Change in volumes relative to the point at which subjects progressed to a clinical diagnosis of AD (the index date) was modeled in aMCI-P. Change in volumes relative to age was modeled in all three clinical groups. RESULTS: In aMCI-P the change in pre to post index rate (i.e., acceleration) of ventricular expansion was 1.7 cm/year, and acceleration in brain shrinkage was 5.3 cm/year. Brain volume declined and ventricular volume increased in all three groups with age. Volume changes decelerated with increasing age in aMCI-P, and to a lesser extent in aMCI-S, but were linear in the matched CN. Among all subjects with aMCI, rates of atrophy were greater in apolipoprotein E ε4 carriers than noncarriers. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of atrophy accelerate as individuals progress from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to typical late onset Alzheimer disease (AD). Rates of atrophy are greater in younger than older subjects with aMCI who progressed to AD and subjects with aMCI who did not progress. We did not find that atrophy rates varied with age in 70- to 90-year-old cognitively normal subjects. ©2008AAN Enterprises, Inc.","","apolipoprotein E4; aged; aging; Alzheimer disease; article; brain atrophy; brain size; brain ventricle; cognition; cognitive defect; comparative study; controlled study; disease course; female; geriatric patient; heterozygote; human; major clinical study; male; model; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal","C.

Dementia Praecox and Paraphrenia, Livingston, Edinburgh.] and Bleuler [1911. Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias. Reprinted 1950 (trans. and ed. J. Zinkin). New York: International Univ. Press.] proposed that cognitive disturbances in schizophrenia are manifestations of brain abnormality. With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methodology, a number of studies have attempted to determine the relationship between brain structure and neurocognition in schizophrenia. We performed a review (1991-to date) of such studies with the aim of identifying the most consistent and compelling findings. The review revealed that whole brain volume tends to correlate with the measures of general intelligence as well as with a range of specific cognitive functions in normal controls and female schizophrenia patients, but this relationship is disrupted in male patients. The enlargement of the third ventricle, relative to the whole brain volume, is associated with deficient abstraction/flexibility, language, and attention/concentration in patients, whereas disproportionally larger lateral ventricles are associated with poorer psychomotor speed and attention/ concentration in women, but not in men, with schizophrenia. Archicortical, but not paleocortical, prefrontal cortex tends to associate with the measures of executive function in both sexes regardless of diagnosis. Temporal lobe, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus correlate with cognitive abilities such as performance speed and accuracy, memory and executive function, verbal endowment and abstraction/categorization, respectively. Some of these medial temporal lobe/neurocognition relationships appear to be specific to schizophrenia (i.e. not seen in controls). Striatal size is positively associated with goal-directed behavior, but not perseveration, in schizophrenia. Larger cerebellum is associated with higher IQ in normal controls and affected women, but this association is disrupted in affected men. Increased white matter of the vermis is associated with poorer language and immediate verbal memory in schizophrenia. Finally, the methodological limitations of the reviewed studies are discussed and suggestions for future research are offered. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

These transgenic (Tg) mice over-express human mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) V717F under control of platelet-derived growth factor promoter (PDAPP mice), and cortical and hippocampal β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits accumulate in heterozygotes after 8-10 mos. We used MRM to obtain 3D volumetric data on mouse brains imaged in their skulls to define genotype- and age-related changes. Hippocampal, cerebellar, and brain volumes and corpus callosum length were quantified in 40-, 100-, 365-, and 630-day-old mice. Measurements taken at age 100 days, before Aβ deposition, revealed a 12.3% reduction of hippocampus volume in Tg mice compared with WT controls. This reduction persisted without progression to age 21 mos. A significant 18% increase in hippocampal volume occurred between 40 and 630 days in WT mice, and no corresponding significant increase occurred in Tg mice. Cavalieri volume estimates of hippocampal subfields from 100-day-old Tg mice further localized a 28% volume deficit in the dentate gyrus. In addition, corpus callosum length was reduced by ≈25% in Tg mice at all ages analyzed. In summary, reduced hippocampal volume and corpus callosum length can be detected by MRM before Aβ deposition. We conclude that overexpression of APP and amyloid may initiate pathologic changes before the appearance of plaques, suggesting novel targets for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and further reinforcing the need for early diagnosis and treatment.","","Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Animals; Brain; Corpus Callosum; Dentate Gyrus; Disease Models, Animal; Heterozygote; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis; Time Factors; Tissue Distribution; Animalia; Mus musculus; amyloid precursor protein; platelet derived growth factor; Alzheimer disease; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; brain size; controlled study; corpus callosum; dentate gyrus; gene overexpression; hippocampus; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; promoter region; protein localization; senile plaque; stereology; transgenic mouse","F.E.

In clinical diagnosis, distinguishing between these conditions and other dementia subtypes such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be difficult. Despite the development of consensus diagnostic criteria, sensitivity for diagnosis remains low, especially outside specialist centres. Neuroimaging techniques using magnetic resonance (MR) can assess changes in structure, microstructure through diffusion tensor imaging and metabolism using spectroscopy and cerebral perfusion. Identification of such changes may contribute to our understanding of the disease process, assist in refining ante-mortem diagnosis and allow disease progression to be measured. This may be both clinically useful and a tool for assessing outcome in therapeutic trials. DLB and PDD share a similar pattern of MRI changes including global brain volume loss, a predominantly subcortical pattern of cerebral atrophy and structural preservation of the medial temporal lobe compared to AD. This review summarises the application and findings from MR studies in DLB and PDD to provide further insight into the similarities between the conditions, highlight the potential for the clinical application of MR techniques and outline promising areas for further research.","","Aged; Atrophy; Cerebral Cortex; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Disease Progression; Humans; Lewy Body Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Protons; Temporal Lobe; proton; aged; atrophy; brain cortex; diffuse Lewy body disease; diffusion weighted imaging; disease course; human; meta analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; review; temporal lobe","R.

The outcome measure was the annual change in the test score in the Structured Interview for the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Dementia and Multi-Infarct Dementia, which includes all items of the Mini-Mental State Examination. Global brain volume, grey matter volume and white matter volume were the only significant independent predictors of the rate of cognitive change. Copyright © 2005 S.

However, validation for this analytic method has seldom been accomplished. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of ICV on gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes. Sixty-three patients with schizophrenia and sixty normal controls were recruited; and high resolution T1 weighted images were obtained by 3T-MRI. After segmentation and normalization of the images into GM, WM, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), multiple regression analyses of global GM and WM volumes were performed using explanatory variables such as diagnosis, ICV, and diagnosis-ICV interaction. In addition, associations between regional GM and WM volumes with ICV were also investigated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). No significant interaction between diagnosis and ICV was found for global GM volume, whereas interactions were detected in restricted GM areas using VBM. On the other hand, an interaction between ICV and diagnosis was found in WM not only for regional volumes, but also for global WM volume. The regression slope of global WM volumes against ICV was steeper in patients with schizophrenia than in healthy controls. These results imply that ICV should be carefully evaluated in the analyses of volumetric studies of schizophrenia, especially when analyzing WM volumes. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To investigate the relationship between monoaminergic transmission and brain structure in alcoholism, the metabolites of dopamine (homovanillic acid, HVA), norepinephrenine (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol, MHPG) and serotonin (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, 5-HIAA) were measured in lumbar CSF in 54 alcohol-dependent patients and 20 healthy subjects. The volumes of the cerebrum, total grey and white matter, total and ventricular CSF, left and right hippocampus, and corpus callosum area were measured with MRI. MHPG and age were positively correlated in alcoholic women. The MAM concentrations were not significantly correlated with the MRI volumes in the subject categories. There were no differences in MAM across subjects defined by diagnosis and gender, age of onset of alcoholism or comorbidity of psychiatric disorders. Total CSF, cerebrum, and white and grey matter tissue volumes differed between patients and healthy subjects. The greatest difference was the white matter reduction in alcoholic women. In alcoholic women and men, monoaminergic neurotransmission measured by the CSF MAM HVA, MHPG, and 5-HIAA is not significantly correlated with the size of different brain structures. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Matsuda et al. have recently developed new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis software, the Voxel-based Specific Regional Analysis System for Alzheimer's Disease (VSRAD), which analyzes brain volume by voxels and yields a hippocampal atrophy index using the Z score. To clarify the usefulness of VSRAD, we compared the severity of disease, intellectual function, and hippocampal atrophy in subjects with AD, vascular dementia (VD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). [Subjects] All of the subjects were outpatients and they could walk without assistance. The subjects consisted of 30 probable AD patients (mean age 80.2 yr), 10 VD patients (76.3 yr), 3 DLB (71.0 yr), and 8 normal controls (NC; 66.4 yr). Each disease was diagnosed according to the DSM-IV and the guidelines for DLB. [Methods] Neuropsychological examinations administered consisted of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for all subjects and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-J cog.) for AD. The impairment of daily life was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Head MRI images were obtained in 1.5-mm-thick sagittal slices and converted into DICOM files. The images were analyzed on a personal computer using the VSRAD system. [Results] 1) The average Z score, which indicates the degree of parahippocampal atrophy compared to age-matched healthy controls, was 3.0±1.3 for AD, 1.7±0.7 for VD, 1.2±0.3 for DLB, and 1.1±0.5 for NC. The Z score for AD was significantly higher than for VD and NC, and the Z score for VD was significantly higher than for NC [Fig. 1]. 2) Only in the AD group were significant correlations observed between the Z score and the MMSE (r2=0.35, p<0.001) and ADAS (r2=0.17, p<0.05). [Conclusions] The VSRAD system provides useful information about hippocampal atrophy that distinguishes AD from VD. In addition, it indicates the severity of AD patients.

Using magnetic resonance imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we tested the hypothesis that surgery would impact brain parameters associated with progression of dementia. Methods: Brain images from the neuroimaging initiative database were used to study normal volunteer subjects and patients with mild cognitive impairment for the age group 55 to 90 inclusive. We compared changes in regional brain anatomy for three visits that defined two intervisit intervals for a surgical cohort (n=41) and a propensity matched nonsurgical control cohort (n=123). The first interval for the surgical cohort contained the surgical date. Regional brain volumes were determined with Freesurfer and quantitatively described with J-image software (University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California). Statistical analysis used Repeated Measures ANCOVA (SPSS, v.18.0; Chicago, IL). Results: We found that surgical patients, during the first follow-up interval (5-9 months), but not subsequently, had increased rates of atrophy for cortical gray matter and hippocampus, and lateral ventricle enlargement, as compared with nonsurgical controls. A composite score of five cognitive tests during this interval showed reduced performance for surgical patients with mild cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Elderly subjects after surgery experienced an increased rate of brain atrophy during the initial evaluation interval, a time associated with enhanced risk for postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Although there was no difference in atrophy rate by diagnosis, subjects with mild cognitive impairment suffered greater subsequent cognitive effects.

Our method allows for generating intermediary (virtual) MR brain volumes from real scans. In addition, we introduce two new descriptor spaces: (i) joint brain tissue deformation displacement vector magnitude and Jacobian and (ii) joint polar angles of displacement vector. In order to conduct our analysis, we built a visualization environment that illustrates images and flows, and it quantifies parameters. Through the calculation of the parameters, of the intermediary MR volumes, we create N-fold information simulating the deformation process. While our method is suitable for every neurodegenerative disease, we empirically tested our scheme on patients with diagnosed Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and normal controls from the ADNI database. We focus on regions containing either ventricles or hippocampus.

While some recent magnetic resonance imaging studies have reported larger age effects in men than women, others find no sex differences. As brain morphometry is a potentially important tool in diagnosis and monitoring of age-related neurological diseases, e.g., Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is important to know whether sex influences brain aging. We analyzed cross-sectional magnetic resonance scans from 1143 healthy participants from seven subsamples provided by four independent research groups. In addition, 96 patients with mild AD were included. Estimates of cortical thickness continuously across the brain surface, as well as volume of 17 subcortical structures, were obtained by use of automated segmentation tools (FreeSurfer). In the healthy participants, no differences in aging slopes between women and men were found in any part of the cortex. Pallidum corrected for intracranial volume showed slightly higher age correlations for men. The analyses were repeated in each of the seven subsamples, and the lack of age x sex interactions was largely replicated. Analyses of the AD sample showed no interactions between sex and age for any brain region. We conclude that sex has negligible effects on the age slope of brain volumes both in healthy participants and in AD.

Aims: To investigate brain structure, asymmetry and IQ in early-onset schizophrenia. Method: Volumes of left and right cerebral hemispheres and IQ were assessed in 33 participants with early-onset DSM-IV schizophrenia and 30 members of a matched, normal control group. Results: Total brain volume was significantly smaller in the group with early-onset disease ('cases') relative to the control group (4.5%), especially for the left hemisphere in males (6.0%). A significant sex x diagnosis interaction in hemisphere asymmetry revealed that the female cases group had significantly reduced rightward asymmetry relative to the female control group and that the male cases tended to have reduced leftward asymmetry relative to the male control group. Decreased left hemisphere volume in males and decreased rightward hemispheric asymmetry in females correlated with reduced IQ. Conclusions: Sexually dimorphic alterations in asymmetry correlate with degree of intellectual impairment in early-onset schizophrenia. Declaration of interest: None.

Here we applied tensor-based morphometry to brain magnetic resonance imaging scans of 732 elderly individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study, to determine associations between homocysteine and brain atrophy. Those with higher homocysteine levels showed greater frontal, parietal, and occipital white matter atrophy in the entire cohort, irrespective of diagnosis, age, or sex. This association was also found when considering mild cognitive impairment individuals separately. Vitamin B supplements, such as folate, may help prevent homocysteine-related atrophy in Alzheimer's disease by possibly reducing homocysteine levels. These atrophy profiles may, in the future, offer a potential biomarker to gauge the efficacy of interventions using dietary folate supplementation. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Alzheimer's disease; atrophy; brain structure; folate; homocysteine; magnetic resonance imaging; vitamin B","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cognition Disorders; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Homocysteine; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; homocysteine; vitamin B group; aged; article; brain atrophy; brain size; controlled study; elderly care; frontal lobe; human; hyperhomocysteinemia; major clinical study; mild cognitive impairment; morphometrics; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occipital lobe; parietal lobe; priority journal; vitamin supplementation; white matter","P.

While some studies suggested that patients with schizophrenia have a pronounced reduction of the volume and neuron number in the MD, more recent data have not found anatomical alterations in this thalamic nucleus. However, most studies have considerable methodological shortcomings. In the present study, we investigated the volume, neuron density and neuron number in the left and right MD in patients with schizophrenia (n = 20) and normal control subjects without neuropsychiatric disorders (n = 18). Patients with schizophrenia showed no significant difference in neuron density and total neuron number in the MD. Compared with the control group, patients with schizophrenia had a smaller MD volume in both hemispheres, a difference that approached significance in the left MD (- 7.3%) when the whole brain volume was included as a covariate. No significant main group effect of diagnosis was found for the right MD volume. There were no significant correlations between MD volume, neuron density, total neuron number and the duration of illness or the age of the patients. Taken together, the present results suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a moderate volume reduction in the left mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, while the neuron density and the total neuron number are unchanged. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The boom of the elderly population comes from public health efforts to improve living conditions and prevent disease, and from improved medical interventions. People more than 65-year-old who are representing 12.9% of the population now is expected to grow to be 19% of the population by 2030. Very few numbers of diseases will have such socioeconomic burden on society in the newer world. Although Alzheimer′s disease (AD) has been studied very well recently, still its exact etiopathogenesis is unknown. Currently there are no available tests for the definitive diagnosis of AD. So the clinical diagnosis of AD remains a diagnosis of exclusion. This limits the potential for early intervention. The difference between normal degenerative processes of brain and preclinical changes of AD is a gray zone and there is no particular way to distinguish between the two. Now several modalities like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) scan, electrophysiological tests and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for tauopathy and A have shown to be promising in the development of early diagnostic tools for neurodegenerative changes and help us to differentiate between healthy aging and pathological aging. In this article we tried to discuss about the differences between pathological and physiological aging process from radiological, pathological, biochemical, and electrophysiological point of view. However, differentiating between physiological and pathological dementia still remains a challenge.","Alzheimer′s disease; cerebrospinal fluid; functional magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography scan; prefontral corex; subjective cognitive complains; whole brain volume","","K.

Patients with Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment have marked atrophy of the hippocampus and amygdala compared with healthy elderly people. Whether a trophy of these structures is also present in persons without cognitive impairment who later develop dementia is unknown. Objective: To assess whether volumetric assessment of the hippocampus and amygdala using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predicts dementia in elderly people without cognitive impairment. Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Setting: A general community in the Netherlands. Participants: Five hundred eleven persons, aged 60 to 90 years, free of dementia at baseline were followed up during 3043 person-years (mean per person, 6.0 years). We performed volumetric assessment of the hippocampus and amygdala, obtained information about daily memory problems, and performed extensive neuropsychological testing in all study participants. Main Outcome Measure: Dementia, as assessed by repeated neuropsychological screening and monitoring of medical records. Results: Thirty-five persons developed dementia (26 with Alzheimer disease). Hippocampal and amygdalar volumes were strongly associated with the risk of dementia; the age-, sex-, and education-adjusted hazard ratio per 1-SD decrease in volume was 3.0 (95% confidence interval, 2.0-4.6) for the hippocampus and 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.9) for the amygdala. The hazard ratios associated with atrophy were similar in persons without memory complaints or low cognitive function at baseline. Compared with those remaining free of dementia, baseline brain volumes were 17% smaller in persons who received a clinical diagnosis of dementia within 2 to 3 years after MRI and still 5% smaller in those whose conditions were diagnosed 6 years after MRI.

This study evaluates the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to detect these changes and investigates the relationship between severity of clinical findings and degree of morphological change. This correlation may provide valuable information in early diagnosis of PD. METHODS: Sixteen patients with early stage PD, eight patients with advanced PD, and eight normal controls were studied by 3T magnetic resonance imaging. The whole brain volume and the volumes of the caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra were calculated on three-dimensional reconstructed images. RESULTS: Putamen volume was significantly diminished in patients with early PD and advanced PD compared with that in controls (P < 0.05), and the percentage of atrophy was 12.5 and 26.5%, respectively. The putamen volume was negatively correlated with Hoehn and Yahr staging (r = -0.720, P < 0.001). Pallidal volume was reduced only in advanced PD (P = 0.023). There were no significant differences in total brain, caudate, or substantia nigra among these three groups CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance imaging-based volumetric measurement is a sensitive method in the assessment of morphological changes of PD in vivo. The putamen atrophy was correlated with the severity of clinical findings. The volumetric measurement of putamen could potentially be a useful indicator of PD in the early stage.

Understanding why these individuals show no cognitive decline, despite high AD pathologic burdens, may be key to discovery of neuroprotective mechanisms. METHODS: A total of 36 subjects who on autopsy had Braak stage V or VI and moderate or frequent neuritic plaque scores based on Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) standards were included. Twelve had normal cognitive function and 24 a diagnosis of AD before death. Demographic characteristics, clinical and pathologic data, as well as antemortem brain volumes were compared between the groups. RESULTS: In multiple regression analysis, antemortem hippocampal and total brain volumes were significantly larger in the group with normal cognitive function after adjusting for gender, age at MRI, time from MRI to death, Braak stage, CERAD neuritic plaque score, and overall presence of vascular disease. CONCLUSION: Larger brain and hippocampal volumes were associated with preserved cognitive function during life despite a high burden of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologic lesions at death. A better understanding of processes that lead to preservation of brain volume may provide important clues for the discovery of mechanisms that protect the elderly from AD. © 2009 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.","","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Cognition; Cohort Studies; Dementia; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Oregon; Organ Size; Risk Factors; Senile Plaques; Alzheimer disease; article; autopsy; brain size; cognition; controlled study; dementia; histopathology; human; morphometrics; neuritis; neuroprotection; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; scoring system; vascular disease; aged; Alzheimer disease; brain; case control study; cohort analysis; comparative study; dementia; female; hippocampus; longitudinal study; male; organ size; pathology; physiology; psychological aspect; risk factor; senile plaque; United States","D.

Most of the clinical symptoms of POE are reminiscent of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, there is general agreement that the phenomenology of POE differs from classical schizophrenia. The temporal lobe hypothesis of schizophrenia put forward in the 1960s notes that episodes with paranoid psychoses are more prevalent in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, the aetiology and pathogenesis of POE are poorly understood. One of the strongest biological findings in schizophrenia is volume loss of temporal lobe structures and the hippocampus in particular. In order to test the hypothesis that atrophy of the hippocampus and the amygdala is found in patients with TLE and POE, we performed a retrospective study of all patients with TLE who were admitted to the assessment unit of the Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy from 1995 until 1999. Twenty-six (2.6%) of these 1008 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria and were compared with 24 patients with TLE without psychopathology and 20 healthy volunteers. All patients underwent extensive MRI investigations, including volumetric data sets and quantitative T2 relaxometry. We found that patients with TLE and POE differed from patients with TLE alone and healthy volunteers in that the total brain volumes were significantly smaller. While there were no differences in hippocampal volumes between the three study groups, there was a significant 16-18% enlargement of the amygdala on both sides in patients with POE. Our findings support the notion that POE is a distinct nosologic entity differing from schizophrenia not only in clinical details but also in neurobiological aspects. The finding of amygdala enlargement agrees with the observation of an association between dysphoric disorders of epilepsy and POE described nearly 100 years ago.","Amygdala; MRI; Psychosis of epilepsy; Schizophrenia; Temporal lobe epilepsy","amygdaloid nucleus; article; clinical article; controlled study; disease classification; human; intractable epilepsy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; paranoia; priority journal; psychosis; temporal lobe epilepsy","L.

MR structural analyses have revealed a number of brain abnormalities including ventricular enlargement, total brain volume reduction, and regional reductions in brain volume in frontal, parietal and temporal regions. However, it is still unknown whether the brain abnormalities observed with MRI in schizophrenia are confounded by chronicity or whether there is a continual degenerative process. Evaluation of the brain structure during the first episode of psychosis (FEP) is a powerful strategy for investigating these fundamental questions. The first-episode design avoids the confusion of chronicity of illness, longstanding substance abuse, and the effects of treatment. Structural MRI studies of patients experiencing a first-episode psychosis have revealed a similar pattern of brain abnormalities as in samples of chronic patients, although deficits may be less extensive. The temporal lobe, a brain structure traditionally implicated in the pathophyisiology of schizophrenia, has been examined often in first-episode studies. Many studies have reported significant abnormalities in the medial areas and superior temporal gyri. However, most studies examining the whole temporal lobe have been unable to show such significant abnormalities. In the light of the increasing amount of ambiguous findings regarding structural temporal lobe abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia experiencing their first-episode of psychosis, a quantitative review of the existing literature was needed to better characterize the temporal lobe deficits observed with MRI in those patients. Thus we conducted a systematic review of structural MRI studies of patients with first-episode schizophrenia in which volume measurements of temporal lobe structures were reported. Using meta-analytical methods, we carried out an analysis of the temporal lobe volumes in these FEP patients and the comparison subjects. In addition to solving the problems of traditional narrative reviews, a meta-analysis provides tools for integrating quantitative data from multiple studies, improving the overall effect size of variables of interest, and increasing statistical power. Eighteen studies were identified as suitable for the present analysis. These studies included 575 FEP patients and 738 control subjects. The average number of patients across studies was 32. The majority of patients in the studies were male (62%) and the average age of patients was 27 years old. In terms of structural brain findings, and assuming a volume of 100% in the comparison group, we found that the mean temporal volume of subjects with FEP was smaller (95%), as well as the analysis of regional structures such as left amygdala (95%), hippocampus-amygdala (left 92%, right 94%), hippocampus (left 85%, right 96%), and left temporal lobe (97%). Right temporal lobe volume was slightly greater (104%) and there was no difference in the volume of the right amygdala. Although this review was focused on evaluating the findings on temporal lobe deficits in patients with a first episode of psychosis, other brain region volumes were analyzed. The whole brain volume (95%) and frontal lobe volume (right 98%, left 99%) were lower in patients than in the comparison subjects. It is important to consider several potential limitations of this study. The first one has to do with the methodology employed to analyze structural MRI data. The method of choice in investigating the distribution of subtle cerebral pathology in schizophrenia has been an examination of anatomically defined regions of interest (ROI) within the brain. This method has some limitations, including the manual tracing of ROI on successive brain slices, a time consuming process that does not easily allow for the comparison of many brain regions or for the examination of volume differences in large samples of subjects. Furthermore, the question of validity is relevant as the ROI is investigator-determined and depends on the complex interindividual variability of the brain. The other method used in two studies included in this review is the voxel-based morphometry (VBM). This is an automated statistical method for examining structural MR images of the brain. VBM methodology makes voxel-wise comparisons of the local concentrations of grey matter between two groups of subjects and offers a more rapid and extensive survey of grey matter abnormalities in patients than ROI analysis. An important limitation of this methodology is that it has less regional sensitivity compared to the ROI technique and that these differences have to be considered in the interpretation of the results. Secondly, although our review only considered studies with patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis in schizophrenia (and not affective psychotic disorders), the fact that different investigators used somewhat different criteria when making their diagnoses could have introduced a potential bias in our inclusion process. Thus, it is possible that our results can not be generalized to the full population of first-episode patients. For instance, although most of the studies included used either DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (16 studies) or the Research Diagnostic Criteria (2 studies), variability may arise because many authors did not consider previous psychotic episodes in which patients were treated with antipsychotic medications for less than 30 days. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that schizophrenic patients present temporal lobe differences, mainly diminished volume values in mesial temporal lobe structures during the initial presentation of a first episode of their illness. However, our results indicated that there was also evidence of global volume changes and regional volume decreases in the frontal lobes of these patients. This data, derived from patients in the early courses of their illness, is compatible with developmental hypotheses of schizophrenic abnormalities and with the view of schizophrenia as a neuropsychiatric disorder with marked deficits in the temporal lobes. However, the central questions in schizophrenia research regarding which brain abnormalities are independent of psychosis and which evolve before and after psychosis begins still remain unanswered. We think that these questions can be addressed by longitudinal neuroimaging studies beginning in the prodromal phase of the illness or by evaluating high-risk subjects during the critical period of transition to first-episode psychosis.","Brain imaging; First-episode of psychosis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Schizophrenia; Temporal lobe","adolescent; adult; brain injury; brain region; brain size; chronicity; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic value; evaluation; female; human; major clinical study; male; measurement; morphometrics; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; psychosis; review; schizophrenia; sex difference; temporal lobe","","","Instituto Mexicano de Psiquiatria","01853325","","SAMEF","","Spanish","Salud Ment.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-20444434414"

This study evaluated brain volumes in healthy older subjects without dementia who presented with memory complaints. The objective was to examine cortical volumes in relation to cognitive performance among patients who do not have dementia, but who do have mild cognitive deficits. Methods. Fifteen participants were evaluated (mean age = 71.8 ± 6.2). Brain structure was measured via high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging to quantify gray and white matter volumes. Volumetric measures were assessed relative to cognitive function in separate regression models controlling for total cerebral volume. Reported here are measures of global cognitive performance using the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) in relation to volumetric measures. Results. Baseline MMSE scores ranged from 27 to 30 (mean = 29.3; SD = 0.9). After controlling for total cerebral volume, we observed that lower white matter volume in the temporal lobe [F(1,14) = 5.72, p = 0.03] was associated with lower performance on the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS). Conclusions. Structural imaging may help provide useful clinical information in the context of mild cognitive decline. Currently, the diagnosis of dementia relies on longitudinal measures of cognition. Future studies will help determine whether the addition of brain imaging may enhance diagnostic certainty as well as predict long-term outcome.

Methods: Thirty-five youths with DSM-IV BPD without psychosis, 19 with BPD with psychosis, 20 with SZ, and 29 healthy controls (HC), similar in age (6-17 years) and sex, underwent structured and clinical interviews, neurological examination, and cognitive testing. Structural magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were acquired on a 1.5 Tesla, General Electric Signa Scanner. Differences in subcortical brain volumes, including the amygdala and hippocampus, were evaluated using two-way (diagnosis, sex) univariate analyses covarying for total cerebral volume and age. Results: Youth with SZ and BPD showed no differences in amygdala and hippocampal volumes. However, boys with SZ had smallest left amygdala and girls with BPD had the smallest left hippocampal volumes. In exploratory analyses, SZ showed reduced thalamic volumes bilaterally and both BPD groups had larger right nucleus accumbens (NA) volumes relative to HC. Conclusion: There were no limbic volumetric differences between BPD and SZ. However, there were diagnosis-by-sex interactions in the amygdala and hippocampus, structures that are rich in sex hormone receptors. In addition, smaller thalamus was associated with SZ while larger right NA volumes were most related to BPD. This study underscores the importance of assessing diagnostic effects and sex effects on the brain in future studies and provides evidence that boys and girls with SZ and BPD may have differential patterns of neuropathology associated with disease expression. © The Author 2007.

Method: Three-dimensional MR images were acquired from 52 (29 males, 23 females) first-episode schizophrenia patients and 40 (22 males, 18 females) healthy subjects. Multiple brain measures (regional brain volume and cortical thickness) were calculated by a fully automated procedure and were used for group comparison and classification by linear discriminant function analysis. Results: Schizophrenia patients showed gray matter volume reductions and cortical thinning in various brain regions predominantly in prefrontal and temporal cortices compared with controls. The classifiers obtained from 66 subjects of the first group successfully assigned 26 subjects of the second group with accuracy above 80%. Conclusion: Our results showed that combinations of automated brain measures successfully differentiated first-episode schizophrenia patients from healthy controls. Such neuroimaging approaches may provide objective biological information adjunct to clinical diagnosis of early schizophrenia. © 2011 Takayanagi et al.","","Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Schizophrenia; adult; article; automation; brain cortex; brain size; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; false positive result; female; functional assessment; gray matter; human; image analysis; major clinical study; male; morphology; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; predictive value; schizophrenia; sensitivity and specificity; social status; thickness; three dimensional imaging; brain; brain mapping; classification; histology; methodology; pathology; pathophysiology","Y.

Neuroimaging is playing an increasingly relevant role in the identification and quantification of AD in vivo, especially in the preclinical stages, when therapeutic intervention could be more effective. Neuroimaging enables quantification of brain volume loss (structural imaging), detection of early cerebral dysfunction (functional imaging), probing into the finest cerebral structures (microstructural imaging), and investigation of amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle build-up (amyloid imaging). Throughout the years, several imaging tools have been developed, ranging from simple visual rating scales to sophisticated computerized algorithms. As recently revised criteria for AD require quantitative evaluation of biomarkers mostly based on imaging, this paper provides an overview of the main neuroimaging tools which might be used presently or in the future in routine clinical practice for AD diagnosis. © 2009 Expert Reviews Ltd.","Alzheimer's disease; Diagnosis; Markers; Multimodal imaging; Neuroimaging; Quantification","Alzheimer Disease; Diagnostic Imaging; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Neuroradiography; biological marker; fluorine 18; Alzheimer disease; amyloidosis; brain atrophy; brain dysfunction; brain size; brain tissue; cerebrovascular disease; clinical practice; computer assisted diagnosis; depression; differential diagnosis; diffuse Lewy body disease; early diagnosis; frontotemporal dementia; functional magnetic resonance imaging; histopathology; human; image analysis; mild cognitive impairment; morphometrics; multiinfarct dementia; neuroanatomy; neurofibrillary tangle; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; quantitative analysis; rating scale; review; single photon emission computer tomography","G.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for more than 40% of dementias in the elderly. The clinical manifestation of AD may be subtle, and early diagnosis is difficult but crucial, to enable early drug intervention and improved prognosis. In order to early diagnose AD, we applied MR volumetry techniques for the hippocampus and cerebrum in an attempt to detect the early changes of AD. From an eligible population of 103 AD patients, 11 with early AD were identified and had MRI performed. 12 normal age-matched controls were also recruited. All AD patients evaluation was based on the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. We compared cerebral and hippocampal volumes of the two groups: normal and AD patients, and found statistically significant difference of total brain volume and hippocampal volume between the two groups. This suggests that, though technically challenging and manually cum time intensive, MR volumetry in the early AD patients is useful and facilitates the detection of the early changes of hippocampal atrophy. © 2002 Nanyang Technological University.","","Artificial intelligence; Brain; Information science; Neurodegenerative diseases; Age-matched controls; Aging population; Alzheimer's disease; Clinical manifestation; Early diagnosis; Health costs; Patients with dementia; Statistically significant difference; Diagnosis","","Rajapakse J.C.; Lee S.-Y.; Wang L.; Fukushima K.; Yao X.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9810475241; 978-981047524-6","","","English","ICONIP - Proc.

The diagnosis of such a type of dementia may be even more difficult when concomitant depressive symptoms occur. We report the case of a 51-year-old woman who was admitted at a Psychiatric Day Hospital presenting with depressive symptoms, visuospatial deficits, apraxia, and minor memory loss. The patient underwent long-term antidepressant therapy, but despite the improvement of depressive symptoms, there was progressive cognitive deterioration. Otherwise, the prior clinical history was unremarkable, and there was no family history of dementia. The clinical examination revealed cognitive deficits in several domains. The patient scored 12 in the Mini-Mental State Examination. Routine laboratory tests were normal. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed global brain volume loss more pronounced than would be expected for someone of the patient's age, especially in the precuneus-a pattern of posterior cortical atrophy consistent with the diagnosis of early-onset AD. Images obtained with 99mTc-HMPAO single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) also revealed marked brain hypoperfusion involving the left parietal lobe, far beyond the regions of brain volume loss. This clinical case report illustrates the relative contribution of both MR imaging and SPECT for the diagnosis of dementia in a patient with concomitant depressive symptoms. Apart from contributing to the diagnosis of dementia beyond the traditional exclusionary approach, neuroimaging is increasingly being used to classify its particular subtypes. The role of neuroimaging role in AD is also supported by a recent proposal of revised diagnostic criteria, which take into account abnormal biomarkers of disease. © 2010.","Alzheimer disease; Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging; Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)","Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Cognition Disorders; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mental Status Schedule; Middle Aged; Technetium Tc 99m Exametazime; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; escitalopram; diagnostic agent; hexamethylpropylene amine oxime technetium tc 99m; adult; Alzheimer disease; amnesia; apraxia; article; brain cortex atrophy; brain perfusion; brain size; case report; depression; dysgraphia; female; human; long term care; memory disorder; mental deterioration; mini mental state examination; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; onset age; parietal lobe; priority journal; single photon emission computer tomography; working memory; Alzheimer disease; brain; cognitive defect; mental health; methodology; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; scintiscanning","A.J.

Brain scans were collected from seventy-one cognitively normal seniors. Seventeen individuals later developed MCI (the presymptomatic MCI; pMCI group), while fifty-four remained normal. Whole brain volume (WBV) and volumes of the entorhinal cortex (ERC), hippocampus, and three subregions of the hippocampus (head; HH, body; HB and tail; HT) were compared. Results indicated that the pMCI group had smaller volumes than the normal group in the ERC, HH and HB, but not the HT or WBV. When HH/HB volumes and baseline memory test scores were included in a single logistic regression model, classification accuracy was very high (area under the curve = 0.93).

Studies varied considerably in terms of the selection of participants, sample characteristics, the definitions of regions of interest and normalization techniques. Effect sizes for differences in left hippocampal volume and right hippocampal volumes of AAMI, MCI and pre-clinical dementia groups compared with controls ranged from 0.47 to 1.34. Effect sizes for left and right hippocampal volumes for Alzheimer's disease (AD) versus control were 1.88 and 1.75 respectively. Longitudinal results confirm that initial hippocampal volume is predictive of conversion to AD.

With dozens of novel drugs in development, there is more need than ever to develop biomarkers that distinguish normal aging from AD and AD from other dementias, track changes over time as disease progresses, and respond to interventions. Future trials will need to weight biomarker outcomes equal to cognitive outcomes especially when the biomarkers are linked to specific mechanisms, such as changes to beta amyloid (Aβ) deposition or brain volume. Since the advent of donepezil as a treatment for AD, new mechanisms of action of this molecule have been discovered.

An important goal within CIND is to identify subgroups that will predictably progress to Alzheimer disease. CIND with amnestic deficits has been associated with high risk of Alzheimer disease but has until now been investigated on a retrospective basis. In this study a prospectively defined amnestic CIND group was characterized on a detailed neuropsychological test battery and on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures. Methods: Amnestic CIND was defined as meeting at least 1 but not all DSM-IV-TR criteria for dementia, scoring ≥1 SD below norms on Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall, having a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5 and a Mini-Mental State Exam score ≥24. This cross-sectional study compared subjects meeting these criteria (n = 25) to age- and education-matched controls (n = 26). The neuropsychological battery included memory and nonmemory measures that were analyzed as continuous variables and dichotomized into impaired (≥1 SD below controls) versus nonimpaired. MRI scans were evaluated with a global-brain volumetric measure [brain fractional ratio (BFR)] and with visually based medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) ratings. Results: Amnestic CIND had neuropsychological impairment in the episodic memory domain and also in nonmemory domains. There were 80% of CIND subjects with multidomain impairment. The most clear-cut nonmemory impairment was in the verbal ability domain, with 64% of subjects affected and a moderate effect size (d = 0.7). On MRI, BFR was lower (74.5 ± 4.6 vs. 75.5 ± 4.4) and MTA higher (72 vs. 38% with MTA ≥1) in CIND than in control subjects. BFR correlated with MTA (r = -0.45) and with a composite memory score (r = 0.296). Conclusion: A prospective amnestic CIND grouping appears to identify individuals with a multidomain pattern of neuropsychological impairment and with both medial temporal lobe and global brain atrophy.

This technique allows the assessment of gray matter volumes in subjects with AD or related conditions compared with healthy controls in an automated fashion, across the whole brain. This article reviews VBM findings related to different AD stages and its prodrome, mild cognitive impairment. These findings include not only gray matter deficits in medial temporal structures as seen in former MRI studies of AD conducted using manual region-of-interest measurements, but also volume changes in several other brain regions not assessed in previous MRI studies. We also discuss potential applications of VBM to improve AD diagnostic accuracy in routine clinical practice. Finally, we highlight future research directions in this field, including: investigations on the relationship between VBM findings of multifocal gray matter deficits and changes in white matter tracts that interconnect such regions; the need for population-based VBM studies using large AD samples; and the potential of studies combining VBM measurements with other potential biological markers (such as brain imaging indices of amyloid-β deposition and cerebrospinal fluid AD markers) to further advance our knowledge about the physiopathology of AD. © 2008 Expert Reviews Ltd.","Alzheimer's disease; Mild cognitive impairment; MRI; Neurodegenerative disease; Neuroimaging; Voxel-based morphometry","Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; amyloid beta protein; Alzheimer disease; brain atrophy; brain region; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical practice; cognitive defect; diagnostic accuracy; gray matter; morphometrics; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; review","G.

Metabolic and perfusion reductions in the parietotemporal association cortex are recognized as a diagnostic pattern for AD. Outstanding progress in the diagnostic accuracy of these modalities has been achieved with statistical analysis on a voxel-by-voxel basis after anatomic standardization of individual scans to a standardized brain volume template instead of visual inspection or a volume-of-interest technique. In a very early stage of AD, this statistical approach revealed losses of gray matter in the entorhinal and hippocampal areas and hypometabolism or hypoperfusion in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. This statistical approach also offers a prediction of the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. The presence of hypometabolism or hypoperfusion in parietal association areas and entorhinal atrophy at the MCI stage have been reported to predict a rapid conversion to AD. A recent advance in voxel-based statistical analysis has markedly enhanced the value of brain perfusion SPECT in diagnosing early AD at the stage of MCI.

It has been questioned whether they are totally separate conditions, or whether they are in fact both part of a spectrum of a more general neurodegenerative disease. Fluctuating cognition and parkinsonism are key features of DLB, but atypical in AD which is characterized by progressive amnesia, aphasia, agnosia and apraxia. Neuropsychiatric disturbances also seem to be more common in DLB. The main neuropathological features of DLB are Lewy bodies, and in AD are senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, though some overlap has been found. A key finding of neuroimaging studies is that there is relative preservation of brain volume in DLB patients compared with AD patients, particularly of temporal lobe structures. There are also profound reductions in striatal dopamine transport in DLB, demonstrated by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) imaging. Whilst there are some distinct differences between AD and DLB, further research is needed to greater define the distinctions between these two conditions. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.","Alzheimer's disease; dementia; dementia with Lewy bodies; neurodegenerative disease","alpha crystallin; alpha synuclein; beta crystallin; dopamine; iodine 123; tau protein; ubiquitin; agnosia; Alzheimer disease; amnesia; amygdaloid nucleus; aphasia; apraxia; article; attention disturbance; behavior disorder; brain size; brain ventricle; clinical feature; cognitive defect; corpus striatum; delusion; depression; differential diagnosis; diffuse Lewy body disease; dopamine uptake; extrapyramidal symptom; frontal lobe; hallucination; hippocampus; human; Lewy body; mini mental state examination; mood change; multiinfarct dementia; neurofibrillary tangle; neuroimaging; neuropathology; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parkinsonism; personality disorder; protein phosphorylation; psychosis; senile plaque; single photon emission computer tomography; temporal lobe","R.J.

DESIGN: Observational follow-up study. SETTING: University teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Participants born in 1921, recruited in 1997/98 to a longitudinal study, who underwent brain MRI in 1999/2000. MEASUREMENTS: Vital status on May 12, 2006, global and regional brain volumes. RESULTS: Thirty-seven of 98 (34.9%) participants died during follow-up. After adjustment for cognitive ability at time of MRI examination, childhood intelligence, sex, hypertension, smoking history, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and age at MRI, proportion of intracranial volume occupied by the brain (brain fraction) predicted death before age 85 (P=.04). Participants with brain fraction less than 0.726 had more than twice the relative risk (2.8, 95% confidence interval=1.1-7.3) of death than participants with brain fraction greater 0.726. Lower survival was significantly associated with lower gray matter volumes in bilateral parietal and left frontoparietal areas and with lower white matter volumes in left parietal and right posterior temporal regions. Cox regression analysis showed that parietal white matter volume (P=.003), a subsequent diagnosis of dementia (P<.001), and sex (P=.004) were independent predictors of survival. CONCLUSION: In participants aged 78 to 79, a lower global brain fraction predicted survival to approximately age 85. Smaller regional volumetric brain reductions, seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD), also predicted survival independent of dementia. The presence of prodromal AD probably explain the main findings. © 2010, Copyright the Authors.

Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States","Context: Relatively little is known about genetic determinants of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Recent studies suggest that a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) prodomain single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in a valine (Val)-to-methionine (Met) substitution is associated with impaired declarative memory in healthy volunteers and patients with schizophrenia. These studies indicate that the BDNFMet variant may mediate hippocampal cognitive functions by modulating intracellular trafficking and activity-dependent BDNF release. To our knowledge, the way in which this functional single nucleotide polymorphism affects other neurocognitive measures has not been examined. Its role in determining cognitive deficits in schizophrenia has also not been systematically studied. Objectives: To characterize the neurocognitive and brain morphometric phenotypic correlates of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and to test the specificity of the BDNF Met variant on cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Design, Setting, and Participants: A comprehensive battery of standardized neuropsychological tests was administered to 144 healthy volunteers and 293 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder at a tertiary care university hospital. Approximately two thirds of the sample also underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging brain scans. Main Outcome Measures: Genotype effects (in Met allele carriers vs Val homozygotes) on 5 cognitive domain z scores and magnetic resonance imaging gray matter brain volume measures (Talairach atlas-based cerebral lobes and optimized voxel-based morphometry) were examined using general linear models. Results: On verbal memory, there was a significant genotype effect but no genotype diagnosis effects. In both patients with schizophrenia and healthy volunteers, Met allele carriers had poorer verbal memory performance than their Val-homozygous counterparts. On visuospatial abilities, there were significant genotype and genotype X diagnosis effects. Met allele-associated visuospatial impairment was specific to patients with schizophrenia but not healthy volunteers. There were significant genotype effects on gray matter volumes within brain regions known to subserve these 2 cognitive domains, with Met allele carriers having smaller temporal and occipital lobar gray matter volumes. Optimized voxel-based morphometry further suggests that parietal heteromodal cortical gray matter deficits may underlie visuospatial impairment in patients with schizophrenia carrying the Met allele. Conclusions: We replicated the association between the BDNFMet variant and poor medial temporal lobe-related memory performance. The consonance of our cognitive and brain morphology findings further suggests that the BDNFMet variant may have a specific role in conferring visuospatial dysfunction in schizophrenia. ©2006 American Medical Association.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Both clinics and the community. Participants: A total of 153 subjects with MCI, 218 cognitively normal older individuals (controls), and 68 patients with Alzheimer disease. Main Outcome Measures: Classification of subjects with MCI according to current subtype diagnostic convention based on neuropsychological performance, estimates of vascular risk based on medical history, research MRI unless there was a specific contraindication, and apolipoprotein E genotype. Results: Of the 153 subjects with MCI, 65 were diagnosed with amnestic single-domain, 46 with amnestic multiple-domain, 27 with nonamnestic single-domain, and 15 with nonamnestic multiple-domain MCI. Analyses of control, MCI, and Alzheimer disease cases revealed significant differences in brain and hippocampal volumes between each group. Post hoc analyses of MRI measures among the MCI subtypes found that patients with amnestic single-domain MCI had significantly less brain atrophy and that hippocampal volume differed significantly from controls for the 2 amnestic forms of MCI. Apolipoprotein E genotype prevalence was significantly greater in the amnestic and nonamnestic subtypes of MCI. Conversely, the nonamnestic subtypes were more likely to have increased vascular risk and to be African American. Conclusions: Amnestic forms of MCI appear to have demographic, genetic, and MRI findings suggestive of Alzheimer disease pathology, whereas the nonamnestic forms of MCI have findings suggestive of vascular disease. Importantly, however, all subjects with MCI showed evidence of brain injury, and the biological differences among subtypes are relatively subtle beyond the memory vs nonmemory groupings. ©2009 American Medical Association.

The authors reviewed the literature on use of voxel-based morphometry in schizophrenia imaging research to examine the capabilities of this method for clearly identifying specific structural differences in patients with schizophrenia, compared with healthy subjects. The authors looked for consistently reported results of relative deficits in gray and white matter in schizophrenia and evaluated voxel-based morphometry methods in order to propose a future strategy for using voxel-based morphometry in schizophrenia research. Method: The authors reviewed all voxel-based morphometry studies of schizophrenia that were published to May 2004 (15 studies). The studies included a total of 390 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 364 healthy volunteers. Results: Gray and white matter deficits in patients with schizophrenia, relative to healthy comparison subjects, were reported in a total of 50 brain regions. Deficits were reported in two of the 50 regions in more than 50% of the studies and in nine of the 50 regions in one study only. The most consistent findings were of relative deficits in the left superior temporal gyrus and the left medial temporal lobe. Use of a smaller smoothing kernel (4-8 mm) led to detection of a greater number of regions implicated in schizophrenia. Conclusions: This review implicates the left superior temporal gyrus and the left medial temporal lobe as key regions of structural difference in patients with schizophrenia, compared to healthy subjects. The diversity of regions reported in voxel-based morphometry studies is in part related to the choice of variables in the automated process, such as smoothing kernel size and linear versus affine transformation, as well as to differences in patient groups. Voxel-based morphometry can be used as an exploratory whole-brain approach to identify abnormal brain regions in schizophrenia, which should then be validated by using region-of-interest analyses.","","Amygdala; Atrophy; Brain; Brain Mapping; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Female; Functional Laterality; Hippocampus; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Schizophrenia; Temporal Lobe; brain region; brain size; clinical research; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; gray matter; human; major clinical study; meta analysis; morphometrics; priority journal; review; schizophrenia; systematic review; technique; temporal lobe; white matter","R.

Hence, our goal was to determine whether addicted and non-addicted schizophrenic patients suffer from different brain deficits. We were especially interested to determine if grey matter volumes were affected by impulsivity. We hypothesized that (comorbid) substance abuse would be associated with enhanced impulsivity and that this enhanced impulsivity would be related to grey matter volume deficits in prefrontal areas. We employed a voxel-based morphometry approach as well as neuropsychological assessment of executive functions and trait impulsivity in 51 participants (age range 23-55). The schizophrenia group comprised 24 patients (12 patients with paranoid schizophrenia and 12 with additional comorbid substance use disorders). The comparison group comprised 27 non-schizophrenic individuals, matched by age and education (14 healthy individuals and 13 patients with substance use disorders). Total grey matter volume deficits were found in all patient groups as compared with healthy controls but were largest (∼8) in both addicted groups. While grey matter volume losses in lateral orbitofrontal and temporal regions were affected by schizophrenia, volume decreases of the medial orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate and frontopolar cortex were associated with addiction. Compared with non-addicted schizophrenics, comorbid patients showed significant volume decreases in anterior cingulate, frontopolar and superior parietal regions. Additionally, they showed an increased non-planning impulsivity that was negatively related to grey matter volumes in the same regions, except for parietal ones. The present study indicates severe grey matter volume and functional executive deficits in schizophrenia, which were only partially exacerbated by comorbid addiction. However, the relationship between non-planning impulsivity and anterior cingulate and frontopolar grey matter volumes points to a specific structure-function relationship that seems to be impaired in schizophrenia-addiction comorbidity. © 2010 The Author.","addiction; executive control; impulsivity; schizophrenia; structural imaging","Adult; Analysis of Variance; Brain; Cognition; Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry); Executive Function; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Impulsive Behavior; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Organ Size; Schizophrenia; Severity of Illness Index; Substance-Related Disorders; addiction; adult; age distribution; article; brain cortex; brain dysfunction; brain size; cingulate gyrus; clinical article; comorbidity; controlled study; disease association; educational status; frontal cortex; gray matter; human; impulsiveness; inhibition (psychology); male; neuropsychological test; orbital cortex; paranoid schizophrenia; parietal lobe; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; schizophrenia; substance abuse; voxel based morphometry; addiction; analysis of variance; brain; cognition; executive function; image processing; impulsiveness; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; pathophysiology; psychiatric diagnosis; schizophrenia; severity of illness index","B.

However, specific genetic determinants of the variance of these quantitative traits are not yet known. Plexins act as receptors for semaphorins and are implicated in axon guidance, which is a key process in brain development. We have previously shown that plexin B3 is a highly potent stimulator of neurite outgrowth, which makes its gene PLXNB3 an intriguing candidate gene for traits related to human brain development and cerebral connectivity. We identified several polymorphisms in PLXNB3 predicting changes of amino acids (V598I, E1156D and V1596E) conserved at the corresponding positions of the orthologs in mouse and chimpanzee. PLXNB3 was genotyped in 303 healthy volunteers and 42 male patients with schizophrenia. Cognitive performance was measured with the vocabulary test (Wortschatztest (WST)), a method to estimate roughly general intelligence (g). Brain morphology was characterized by magnetic resonance imaging. Compared to subjects not carrying the modern, human-specific haplotype A, carriers of A scored higher in vocabulary test (WST) irrespective of diagnosis (P=0.0004). This effect could be observed in three independent groups (healthy males: P=0.048; schizophrenic males: P=0.034 and healthy females: P=0.037). Additionally, the haplotype A was associated with increased volume of brain white matter that in turn correlated with performance in the vocabulary test. These findings suggest that plexin B3 may influence cognitive performance, and the development of white matter in vivo in a way similar to its known stimulating effect on neurite outgrowth in vitro. These novel observations warrant further replication in independent samples. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.","Adhesion molecule; Brain morphology; Cognitive function; Genetic association study; Plexin B3; Verbal performance","Adult; Aged; Brain; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Female; Haplotypes; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Fibers, Myelinated; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Schizophrenia; Verbal Learning; plexin; plexin b3; unclassified drug; adult; aged; amino acid substitution; article; brain development; brain size; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; correlation analysis; DNA polymorphism; female; gene; genetic association; genotype; haplotype; heterozygote; human; male; nerve fiber growth; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; orthology; phenotype; PLXNB3 gene; priority journal; schizophrenia; verbal behavior; white matter","D.

The present longitudinal study builds on an earlier cross-sectional report demonstrating brain abnormalities in adolescent-onset psychosis patients with a recent-onset first episode of psychosis. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were obtained at baseline and 2 years later from 21 adolescents with psychosis and 34 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and years of education. Whole-brain volumes and gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes were measured at baseline and at 2-year follow-up. In the frontal lobe, the rate of GM volume loss was significantly higher in male patients (2.9% and 2.0%, respectively, for left and right) than in controls (1.2% and 0.7%, respectively, for left and right). In the left frontal lobe, male patients showed a significantly higher rate of CSF volume increase than controls (8.6% vs 6.4%). These differences in rates of volume change were observed in male and female patients, although only males showed significant time x diagnosis interactions. This negative finding in females should be interpreted with caution as the study was underpowered to detect change in women due to limited sample size. An exploratory analysis revealed that schizophrenia and nonschizophrenia psychotic disorders showed similar volume change patterns relative to controls. Change in clinical status was not correlated with longitudinal brain changes. Our results support progression of frontal lobe changes in males with adolescent-onset psychosis. © The Author 2008.

Method: Magnetic resonance imaging studies were performed on 23 psychotic adolescents (12-18 years old, 17 males, 6 females) consecutively admitted to an adolescent inpatient unit and on 37 normal controls (13-18 years, 23 males, 14 females) matched for age, sex, and years of education. Diagnosis was made at baseline on the basis of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version and confirmed after 12 months of follow-up. Total brain volume and gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes were measured bilaterally using a segmentation method based on the Talairach grid system. Results: Male patients showed significantly larger volumes than did male controls in overall CSF and left frontal and right parietal sulci CSF. Male patients also showed significantly lower volumes of gray matter in the right and left frontal lobes. No significant volumetric differences were found in females. There were no differences between individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia at follow-up and the rest of the patients. Conclusions: This study suggests that larger CSF and lower gray matter volumes in the frontal lobes may be a nonspecific vulnerability marker for psychosis in male adolescents. ©2005 by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.","Brain volumes; First episode; Magnetic resonance imaging; Psychosis","biochemical marker; adolescent; adult; article; brain mapping; brain size; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical article; controlled study; female; follow up; frontal lobe; gray matter; hospital patient; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; psychosis; schizophrenia; school child; volumetry; white matter","D.

The goal of this study was to develop, validate, and apply an MR imaging tracing method for the parcellation of 3 major gyri of the frontal lobe, which uses only local landmarks intrinsic to the structures of interest, without the need for global reorientation or the use of dividing planes or lines. METHODS: Studies were performed on 25 subjects-healthy controls and subjects diagnosed with Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer disease-with significant variation in the underlying gyral anatomy and state of atrophy. The protocol was evaluated by using multiple observers tracing scans of subjects diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease and those aging normally, and the results were compared by spatial overlap agreement. To confirm the results, observers marked the same locations in different brains. We illustrated the variabilities of the key boundaries that pose the greatest challenge to defining consistent parcellations across subjects. RESULTS: The resulting gyral volumes were evaluated, and their consistency across raters was used as an additional assessment of the validity of our marking method. The agreement on a scale of 0-1 was found to be 0.83 spatial and 0.90 volumetric for the same rater and 0.85 spatial and 0.90 volumetric for 2 different raters. The results revealed that the protocol remained consistent across different neurodegenerative conditions. CONCLUSION: Our method provides a simple and reliable way for the volumetric evaluation of frontal lobe neurodegeneration and can be used as a resource for larger comparative studies as well as a validation procedure of automated algorithms.","","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Dominance, Cerebral; Female; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Lewy Body Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mathematical Computing; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Reference Values; Reproducibility of Results; adult; aged; aging; Alzheimer disease; article; brain atrophy; clinical article; controlled study; degenerative disease; dementia; diffuse Lewy body disease; female; frontal lobe; human; male; nerve degeneration; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quantitative diagnosis; volumetry","B.

However, little is known about the association between progressive brain volume change in schizophrenia and BDNF genotype. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between hippocampal volume change in patients with schizophrenia and healthy control subjects and BDNF genotype. Two structural magnetic resonance imaging brain scans were acquired of 68 patients with schizophrenia and 83 healthy subjects with an interval of approximately 5 yrs. Hippocampal volume change was measured and related to BDNF genotype in patients and healthy controls. BDNF genotype was not associated with hippocampal volume change over time in patients or healthy controls, nor could we replicate earlier findings on smaller hippocampal volume in Met-carriers. However, we did find a genotype-by-diagnosis interaction at baseline demonstrating smaller hippocampal volumes in patients homozygous for the Val-allele relative to healthy Val-homozygotes. In addition, irrespective of genotype, patients showed smaller hippocampal volumes compared with healthy controls at baseline. In summary, our results suggest that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is not associated with hippocampal volume change over time. Nevertheless, our findings may support the possibility that BDNF affects brain morphology differently in schizophrenia patients and healthy subjects. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","BDNF; Hippocampus; Longitudinal; Magnetic resonance imaging; Schizophrenia","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Amino Acid Substitution; Atrophy; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Hippocampus; Humans; Male; Methionine; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Genetic; Schizophrenia; Valine; Young Adult; brain derived neurotrophic factor; methionine; valine; adolescent; adult; aged; allele; article; brain scintiscanning; brain size; controlled study; female; gene expression; gene frequency; genetic association; genotype; heterozygote; homozygote; human; major clinical study; male; neuroprotection; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; schizophrenia; schizophreniform disorder; single nucleotide polymorphism","P.

Volumetric changes are observed in multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and in normal aging. A novel method is presented to segment brain tissue based on quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) of the longitudinal relaxation rate R1, the transverse relaxation rate R2 and the proton density, PD. Methods Previously reported qMRI values for WM, GM and CSF were used to define tissues and a Bloch simulation performed to investigate R1, R2 and PD for tissue mixtures in the presence of noise. Based on the simulations a lookup grid was constructed to relate tissue partial volume to the R1-R 2-PD space. The method was validated in 10 healthy subjects. MRI data were acquired using six resolutions and three geometries. Results Repeatability for different resolutions was 3.2% for WM, 3.2% for GM, 1.0% for CSF and 2.2% for total brain volume. Repeatability for different geometrieswas 8.5% forWM, 9.4% for GM, 2.4% for CSF and 2.4% for total brain volume. Conclusion We propose a new robust qMRI-based approach which we demonstrate in a patient with MS. Key Points • A method for segmenting the brain and estimating tissue volume is presented • This method measures white matter, grey matter, cerebrospinal fluid and remaining tissue • The method calculates tissue fractions in voxel, thus accounting for partial volume • Repeatability was 2.2% for total brain volume with imaging resolution <2.0 mm © European Society of Radiology 2012.","Brain segmentation; Brain volume estimation; Partial volume; Quantitative MRI; Tissue classification","adult; anthropometric parameters; article; brain segmentation; brain size; cerebrospinal fluid; controlled study; female; gray matter; human; human experiment; longitudinal relaxation rate; male; neuroimaging; noise; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; proton density; quantitative magnetic resonance imaging; radiological parameters; reproducibility; simulation; transverse relaxation rate; validation process; white matter","J.

In the past neuroprotection has been an active field of research in medical areas ranging diversely from neurology through cardiology to ophthalmology. However, it has only been in recent years that the psychiatric community began to sit up and take notice - be it due to improved technological imaging capabilities or because of the growing dissatisfaction with current pharmacological treatments (particularly in schizophrenia) regarding negative and cognitive symptom domains, second generation antipsychotics included. Mounting evidence indicates that neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, schizophrenia, mood and cognitive disorders all have a neurodegenerative component proposed to be due to various mechanisms including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, myelin dysfunction and apoptosis to name just a few. New and improved imaging techniques combined with advanced cognitive testing continue to help us assess this degenerative component. However, despite considerable research effort, clinical trials in search of an agent that can effectively protect the brain of patients with schizophrenia, mood and cognitive disorders have been largely disappointing as of yet. Thus, it would seem that the continuing search for neuroprotective factors in psychiatry would be especially pertinent for finding novel treatments and augmentation strategies - not only for treating active symptoms, but also for slowing down disease progression and possibly even providing primary prevention in recognized prodromal states. As of now several drugs, hormones, neurosteroids, vitamins as well as various other substances have been studied regarding their neuroprotective properties in psychiatric disorders, with variable amounts of success. Other neuroprotective approaches being studied include the utilization of nanotechnological scientific advances as well as neuromodulatory techniques (such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, vagal nerve stimulation and deep brain stimulation). In this chapter we will review the trends in psychiatric neuroprotection in the past and the present in addition to raising questions for future directions and challenges. The present overview will cover the evidence concerning the different theoretical frameworks regarding the basis of psychiatric neuropathology and specifically their applicability to the field of neuroprotection. The different classification possibilities of neuroprotective candidates are also discussed. Finally, we will propose using a separate term in an attempt to differentiate psychiatric neuroprotection from other forms of neuroprotection - psychoprotection. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.","Bipolar disorder; Brain volume; Cannabis; Deep brain stimulation; Diffusion tensor imaging; Dysconnectivity; Erythropoietin; Estrogen; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Major depressive disorder; Nanoneuroscience; Neurodegeneration; Neurodevelopment; Neuroprotection; Neurosteroids; Psychoprotection; Schizophrenia; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Vagal nerve stimulation","","","","Springer Netherlands","","978-904818553-5; 978-904818552-8","","","English","Brain Protect. in Schizophrenia, Mood and Cogn.

Recent studies in sporadic subcortical ischemic vascular disease have drawn attention to brain atrophy as a clinically important marker of disease progression. However, little is known about the role of brain atrophy and its clinical correlates in CADASIL. METHOD: The authors determined the normalized brain volume (NBV) and percent brain volume change (PBVC) over 2 years in 76 CADASIL subjects (45.1 ± 9.7 years) using the SIENA (structural image evaluation using normalization of atrophy) software and its adaptation for cross-sectional measurements (SIENAX). Baseline assessments included systolic blood pressure (SBP), homocysteine levels, BMI, and APOE genotyping. T2-lesion volumes and clinical scales were assessed at both time points. RESULTS: The NBV significantly correlated with all clinical scores (Rankin, NIH Stroke Scale, Barthel, structured interview for the diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia and multi-infarct dementia, Mattis dementia rating scale) at both time points independently of age and sex. PBVC correlated with changes of all clinical scores (all p < 0.01) except for the Mattis dementia rating scale (p = 0.10). In a linear regression model, age (p < 0.001), male sex (p < 0.01), and SBP (p = 0.07) were the main risk factors for a lower NBV at baseline. Age (p < 0.001) and SBP (p = 0.01) were risk factors for brain volume loss during follow-up. Sample size estimates showed that the number of individuals needed to demonstrate a treatment effect in a trial can be reduced when PBVC is used as an endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies brain atrophy as an important aspect of the disease process in CADASIL and establishes significant correlations with multiple clinical aspects including cognition. Age and systolic blood pressure are risk factors for brain volume loss during follow-up. Percent brain volume change seems promising as an adjunct outcome measure in future interventional trials.

Regional brain atrophy patterns differ in the two disorders, however, and magnetic resonance imaging is sometimes helpful in distinguishing them in the later stages. We measured whole brain and regional volumes, including cerebellum, pons, midbrain, superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), and ventricular volumes as well as frontal and posterior-inferior cerebral regions in 18 subjects with PSP, 9 with MSA-P (parkinsonian phenotype), 9 with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 18 healthy controls. Associations between these volumes, cognitive profiles, and clinical measures of disease severity and motor disability were assessed. Mean midbrain volume was 30% smaller in PSP than in PD or controls (P < 0.001) and 15% smaller than in MSA-P (P = 0.009). The mean SCP volume in PSP was 30% smaller than in MSA-P, PD, or controls (P < 0.001). Mean cerebellar volumes in MSA-P were 20% smaller than in controls and PD and 18% smaller than in PSP (P = 0.01). Mean pontine volume in MSA-P was 30% smaller than in PD or controls (P < 0.001) and 25% smaller than in PSP (P = 0.01). Motor disability was most strongly associated with midbrain volume, and more severe executive dysfunction was associated with reduced frontal volume. These distinct patterns of cortical and subcortical atrophy, when considered together rather than independently, better differentiate PSP and MSA-P from each other and also from healthy controls. © 2006 Movement Disorder Society.","Clinico-radiological correlations; MSA; PSP","Aged; Atrophy; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Ventricles; Disability Evaluation; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple System Atrophy; Neurologic Examination; Neuropsychological Tests; Parkinson Disease; Parkinsonian Disorders; Reference Values; Severity of Illness Index; Software; Statistics; Statistics as Topic; Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive; adult; aged; article; brain cortex atrophy; brain region; brain size; brain ventricle; cerebellum; clinical article; clinical assessment; cognitive defect; controlled study; correlation analysis; differential diagnosis; disease severity; frontal cortex; heart ventricle volume; human; mesencephalon; motor dysfunction; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; parkinsonism; pons; priority journal; progressive supranuclear palsy; quantitative analysis; radiodiagnosis; Shy Drager syndrome; statistical analysis","D.C.

Identification of dementia, associated with loss of cognitive ability beyond normal aging, and especially converters - the subgroup of individuals at risk for developing dementia - has recently gained importance. For this purpose atrophy markers have been explored and their effectiveness has been evaluated both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. However, more research is needed to understand the dynamics of atrophy markers at different disease stages, which requires temporal analysis of local along with global changes. Unfortunately, most of the longitudinal neuroimaging data available in the clinical settings is acquired at largely varying time intervals. In the light of the above, this study presents a novel methodology to process longitudinal neuroimaging data acquired incompletely and at different time intervals, and explores complementary nature of local and global brain volume changes in identifying dementia. Results on the OASIS database demonstrate discriminative power of global atrophy in hippocampus (as early as two years after the first visit) for identifying demented cases, and local volume shrinkage of thalamus proper (as early as three years after the first visit) for differentiating converters. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Alzheimer's disease; Brain atrophy; Converters; Dementia; Early detection; Longitudinal analysis; Longitudinally varying neuroimaging data; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mild cognitive impairment; Segmentation; Subcortical structures","Aged; Algorithms; Brain; Dementia; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Organ Size; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique; Brain; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Torque converters; Alzheimer's disease; Brain atrophy; Cognitive impairment; Dementia; Longitudinal analysis; Longitudinally varying neuroimaging data; Subcortical structures; adult; aged; aging; Alzheimer disease; article; brain; brain atrophy; brain size; controlled study; dementia; early diagnosis; hippocampus; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; mild cognitive impairment; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; thalamus; Neuroimaging","D.

The reproducibility of the algorithms was assessed using the 3D T1 weighted MP-RAGE scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. The back-to-back (BTB) MP-RAGE scans in the ADNI data set makes it a valuable benchmark against which to assess the performance of algorithms of measuring atrophy in the human brain with MRI scans. A total of 671 subjects were included for SienaX and 385 subjects for Siena. The annual percentage brain volume change (PBVC) rates were -0.65 ± 0.82%/year for the healthy controls, -1.15 ± 1.21%/year for mild cognitively impairment (MCI) and -1.84 ± 1.33%/year for AD, in line with previous findings. The median of the absolute value of the reproducibility of SienaX's normalized brain volume (NBV) was 0.96% while the 90th percentile was 5.11%. The reproducibility of Siena's PBVC had a median of 0.35% and a 90th percentile of 1.37%. While the median reproducibility for SienaX's NBV was in line with the values previously reported in the literature, the median reproducibility of Siena's PBVC was about twice that reported. Also, the 90th percentiles for both SienaX and Siena were about twice the size that would be expected for a Gaussian distribution. Because of the natural variation of the disease among patients over a year, a perfectly reproducible whole brain atrophy algorithm would reduce the estimated group size needed to detect a specified treatment effect by only 30% to 40% as compared to Siena's. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Alzheimer's disease; Non Gaussian distributions; Power calculations","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Atrophy; Automation; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Cognition Disorders; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Software; algorithm; article; brain atrophy; brain size; controlled study; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; measurement; mild cognitive impairment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; reproducibility; three dimensional imaging","K.S.

This study was conducted to identify structural brain abnormalities in the prenatal and neonatal periods associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia. Method: Prenatal ultrasound scans and neonatal structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging were prospectively obtained in the offspring of mothers with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (N=26) and matched comparison mothers without psychiatric illness (N=26). Comparisons were made for prenatal lateral ventricle width and head circumference, for neonatal intracranial, CSF, gray matter, white matter, and lateral ventricle volumes, and for neonatal diffusion properties of the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum and corticospinal tracts. Results: Relative to the matched comparison subjects, the offspring of mothers with schizophrenia did not differ in prenatal lateral ventricle width or head circumference. Overall, the high-risk neonates had nonsignificantly larger intracranial, CSF, and lateral ventricle volumes. Subgroup analysis revealed that male high-risk infants had significantly larger intracranial, CSF, total gray matter, and lateral ventricle volumes; the female high-risk neonates were similar to the female comparison subjects. There were no group differences in white matter diffusion tensor properties. Conclusions: Male neonates at genetic risk for schizophrenia had several larger than normal brain volumes, while females did not. To the authors' knowledge, this study provides the first evidence, in the context of its limitations, that early neonatal brain development may be abnormal in males at genetic risk for schizophrenia.","","Brain; Brain Diseases; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Lateral Ventricles; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nervous System Malformations; Pregnancy; Prenatal Diagnosis; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia; adult; article; brain; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical article; corpus callosum; diffusion tensor imaging; female; fetus echography; genetic risk; gray matter; head circumference; high risk infant; human; lateral brain ventricle; male; newborn; newborn period; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prenatal period; priority journal; progeny; pyramidal tract; schizoaffective psychosis; schizophrenia; white matter; brain; brain disease; comparative study; genetics; nervous system malformation; pathology; pregnancy; prenatal diagnosis; procedures; psychosis; schizophrenia; statistics and numerical data","J.

Background: Bipolar disorder is a pleomorphic condition, with varying manifestations that are determined by a number of complex factors including the ""stage"" of illness. It is consequently a notoriously difficult illness to diagnose and as a corollary is associated with lengthy delays in recognition and the initiation of suitable treatment. Methods: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE augmented by a manual search. Results: Emerging neuroimaging data suggests that, in contrast to schizophrenia, where at the time of a first-episode of illness there is already discernible volume loss, in bipolar disorder, gross brain structure is relatively preserved, and it is only with recurrences that there is a sequential, but marked loss of brain volume. Recent evidence suggests that both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are more effective if instituted early in the course of bipolar disorder, and that with multiple episodes and disease progression there is a noticeable decline in treatment response. Conclusions: Such data supports the notion of clinical staging, and the tailored implementation of treatments according to the stage of illness. The progressive nature of bipolar disorder further supports the concept that the first episode is a period that requires energetic broad-based treatment, with the hope that this could alter the temporal trajectory of the illness. It also raises hope that prompt treatment may be neuroprotective and that this perhaps attenuates or even prevents the neurostructural and neurocognitive changes seen to emerge with chronicity. This highlights the need for early identification at a population level and the necessity of implementing treatments and services at a stage of the illness where prognosis is optimal. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.","Bipolar disorders; Diagnosis; Early intervention; Mania depression; Neuroprotection","Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Age of Onset; Antidepressive Agents; Antimanic Agents; Bipolar Disorder; Brain; Cognition Disorders; Comorbidity; Depressive Disorder, Major; Electroconvulsive Therapy; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychology; Psychotherapy; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors; bipolar disorder; brain; brain size; differential diagnosis; disease course; drug efficacy; drug response; early diagnosis; human; major depression; medical literature; MEDLINE; neuroimaging; neuroprotection; psychotherapy; recurrent disease; review; schizophrenia; therapy effect","M.

Structural MRI studies and functional studies using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are widely used in diagnosis of AD. Outstanding progress in diagnostic accuracy of these neuroimaging modalities has been obtained using statistical analysis on a voxel-by-voxel basis after spatial normalization of individual scans to a standardized brain-volume template instead of visual inspection or a conventional region of interest technique. In a very early stage of AD, this statistical approach revealed gray matter loss in the entorhinal and hippocampal areas and hypometabolism or hypoperfusion in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. These two findings might be related in view of anatomical knowledge that the regions are linked through the circuit of Papez.

To our knowledge, cortical thickness, a measure of particular interest in schizophrenia, has not previously been evaluated in terms of its heritability in relationship to risk for schizophrenia. Objective: To quantify the distribution and heritabil- ity of cortical thickness changes in schizophrenia. Design: We analyzed a large sample of normal controls, affected patients, and unaffected siblings using a surface-based approach. Cortical thickness was compared between diagnosis groups on a surfacewide node- by-node basis. Heritability related to disease risk was assessed in regions derived from an automated cortical parcellation algorithm by calculating the Risch X. Setting: Research hospital. Participants: One hundred ninety-six normal controls, 115 affected patients with schizophrenia, and 192 unaffected siblings. Main Outcome Measure: Regional cortical thickness. Results: Node-by-node mapping statistics revealed widespread thickness reductions in the patient group, most pronouncedly in the frontal lobe and temporal cortex. Unaffected siblings did not significantly differ from normal controls at the chosen conservative threshold. Risch X analysis revealed widespread evidence for heritability for cortical thickness reductions throughout the brain. Conclusions: To our knowledge, the present study provides the first evidence of broadly distributed and heritable reductions of cortical thickness alterations in schizophrenia. However, since only trend-level reductions of thickness were observed in siblings, cortical thickness per se (at least as measured by this approach) is not a strong intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia. © 2009 American Medical Association.

We examined associations between global (BMI) and central (waist circumference) midlife obesity and subsequent trajectories of regional brain atrophy in 152 individuals [M (age) = 69 ± 7.8] prospectively followed through the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging; 21 individuals became impaired during follow-up. We report no associations (P > 0.05) between either global or central midlife obesity and subsequent rates of regional brain volume changes against a background of age-related atrophy in older individuals who remained nondemented. When looking at the entire sample, greater decline was observed in the volume of gray matter, precuneus, cingulate and orbito-frontal gyri for globally obese (P < 0.03), even though only data up to the point of dementia diagnosis were included in the analyses (i.e., while still considered clinically normal). Moreover, when trajectories of regional volume changes were examined across the range of BMI and waist circumference values instead of employing a cut-off point to define obesity, a different pattern of results emerged. Overall, our results suggest that midlife obesity may be an important modifier of brain atrophy in individuals who are developing cognitive impairment and dementia, while it has little effect on structural brain integrity in nondemented older adults. Moreover, the discrepancies in findings between studies may be in part due to participant sampling and methodological differences.

Objective: To examine the progression of brain changes in first-episode early-onset psychosis and their relationship to diagnosis and prognosis at 2-year follow-up. Design: Prospective, multicenter, naturalistic, 2-year follow- up study. Setting: Six child and adolescent psychiatric units in Spain. Participants: A total of 110 patients and 98 healthy controls were recruited between March 1, 2003, and November 31, 2005. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed for 61 patients with schizophrenia (n=25), bipolar disorder (n=16), or other psychoses (n=20) and 70 controls (both at baseline and after 2 years of follow-up). Mean age at baseline was 15.5 years (patients) and 15.3 years (controls). Main Outcome Measures: The GM and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes in the total brain and frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Results: Compared with controls, patients with schizophrenia showed greater GM volume loss in the frontal lobe during the 2-year follow-up (left: -3.3 vs -0.6 cm 3, P=.004; right: -3.7 vs -0.8 cm 3, P=.005) and left frontal CSF volume increase (left: 6.7 vs 2.4 cm 3, P=.006). In addition to frontal volume, changes for total GM (-37.1 vs -14.5 cm 3, P=.001) and left parietalGM(-4.3 vs -2.2 cm 3, P=.04) were significantly different in schizophrenic patients compared with controls. No significant differences emerged for patients with bipolar disease. Greater left frontal GM volume loss was related to more weeks of hospitalization, whereas severity of negative symptoms correlated with CSF increase in patients with schizophrenia. Conclusions: Patients with schizophrenia or other psychoses showed greater loss of GM volume and increase of CSF in the frontal lobe relative to controls. Progressive changes were more evident in patients with schizophrenia than those with bipolar disorder. These changes in specific brain volumes after onset of psychotic symptoms may be related to markers of poorer prognosis. ©2012 American Medical Association.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A canonical three-dimensional MR image atlas was used as a deformable template and automatically matched to three-dimensional MR images of 10 individuals (five healthy and five schizophrenic subjects). A subvolume containing the hippocampus was defined by using 16 landmarks that constrained the automated search for hippocampal boundaries. Transformation of the hippocampus template was automatically performed by using global pattern matching through a sequence of low- then high-dimensional translations, rotations, and scalings. RESULTS: The average test-retest volume difference measured with the automatic method was 3.1%, compared with the manual test- retest difference of 7.1%. Correlation between automated and manually determined volumes demonstrated the validity of the automated technique (intraclass correlation coefficient = .86). CONCLUSION: The automated method estimates hippocampal volumes with less variability (ie, lower variance) than that of manual outlining.","Brain, volume; Hippocampus; Magnetic resonance (MR), image processing; Magnetic resonance (MR), volume measurement; Schizophrenia","article; automation; brain mapping; brain size; clinical article; controlled study; hippocampus; human; human cell; human tissue; morphometrics; neuroanatomy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; quantitative diagnosis","","","Radiological Society of North America Inc.","00338419","","RADLA","9015081","English","RADIOLOGY","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031015919"

Ventricular and extraventricular CSF was quantified, and the effects of aging were studied; in both groups, the atrophy measurement was used to correct metabolic values obtained with positron emission tomography. Patients with Alzheimer dementia had higher total CSF; extraventricular, total ventricular, and third ventricular CSF volumes (49%, 37%, 99%, and 74%, respectively); and 7% lower brain volumes than the control group. The patients also showed a more marked decline in brain volumes and a greater increase in CSF volumes with advancing age than the control group. They had a 25.0% increase in corrected whole-brain metabolic rates; the control group had only a 15.8% increase. The use of this technique may provide a basis for further studies of aging and dementia, including regional volume analysis.","Brain, MR studies, 10.1214; Brain, volume, 10.1214, 10.83; Cerebrospinal fluid, MR studies, 10.1214; Dementia, 10.83; Images, processing","fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; adult; aged; aging; Alzheimer disease; brain; brain atrophy; cerebrospinal fluid; conference paper; controlled study; diagnosis; female; human; male; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; priority journal; volumetry","","","Radiological Society of North America Inc.","00338419","","RADLA","1984290","English","Radiology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025957221"

In vivo measurements provided by MRS have greatly enhanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of dementia. Increases in choline and rayo-inositol (markers of membrane turnover) have been demonstrated in several studies on patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting the presence of a significant cellular membrane (and glial) pathology in this disorder. Large decreases in brain /V-acetylaspartate (NAA) (a marker of neuroaxonal integrity) are commonly seen in AD as well as in other forms of dementia in cerebral gray and white matter, indicating the presence of significant axonal damage. Since greater NAA decreases have been demonstrated in brains of patients with clinically more severe disease, NAA could provide an index relevant to patients' clinical status. Brain metabolic changes can be independent of abnormalities detected by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), since proton MRS may show a normal metabolic pattern in patients with mild neurological impairment and severe MRI abnormalities. However, quantitative measurements of regional brain volumes can be useful in the diagnosis of dementia. Thus, proton MRS, alone or combined with new quantitative magnetic resonance techniques, can provide sensitive indices able to monitor disease progression or effects of drug therapy. 0 Springer-Verlag 1999.","","Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Dementia; Dementia, Vascular; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Protons; diagnostic agent; proton; Alzheimer disease; brain; dementia; human; methodology; multiinfarct dementia; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; pathology; review","","","Springer Milan","03920461","","IJNSD","10662965","English","Ital.

Whole brain volume, cerebrospinal fluid volume, volumes of the temporal, frontal and parietal lobes, the cerebellum and the amygdala-hippocampus complex were determined using a personal computer-based software. Seventeen patients with VD, 22 patients with AD and 13 healthy controls were included. Analysis of covariance using age as covariate demonstrated significant mean differences between controls and dementia groups with respect to all morphological parameters. However, apart from the volume of the cerebellum no significant volumetric differences were found between VD and AD. These results indicate that MRI-based volumetry allows differentiation between AD or VD from normal controls and that measurement of cerebellar volume may be of use to separate vascular and degenerative dementia. However, since the distribution of cerebral atrophy in both dementia groups is very similar, it is suggested that the atrophic changes are not specific to the underlying cause but rather reflect the selective vulnerability of neuronal structures.","Alzheimer's disease; MRI; Subcortical vascular dementia; Volumetry","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Dementia, Vascular; Female; Humans; Male; adult; aged; alzheimer disease; amygdaloid nucleus; article; brain atrophy; brain size; cerebellum; cerebrospinal fluid; clinical article; computer program; controlled study; differential diagnosis; female; frontal lobe; hippocampus; human; male; multiinfarct dementia; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parietal lobe; priority journal; temporal lobe","","","","14208008","","DGCDF","9769443","English","Dementia Geriatr.

Nineteen normal subjects and nine patients with AD underwent serial three-dimensional MRI (6- to 30-month scan intervals). Repeat studies were registered to the baseline studies. The accuracy of the BBSI was assessed by comparison with simulated atrophy and with segmentation; it was also tested for reproducibility, linearity, and its ability to discriminate patients with AD from healthy controls. The BBSI correlated closely with simulated volumes of atrophy (r = 1.000). The mean absolute difference between repeat measures was 1.51 ml or .13% of mean brain volume. Rates of atrophy from all 18 AD scan pairs were widely separated from those of all 31 control pairs. In matched subgroups, the mean (SD) annual rate of brain atrophy in nine controls was .24% (.32%), compared with 2.78% (.92%) in nine patients with AD. We conclude that the BBSI is a linear and highly reproducible measure of atrophy with potential uses in the early diagnosis and measurement of progression in Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease; Atrophy; Brain; Image registration","Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Brain; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Structural; Reproducibility of Results; adult; aged; alzheimer disease; article; brain atrophy; brain size; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; disease course; female; human; male; measurement; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; reproducibility; simulation; validation process","","","","10531807","","JMRIF","9400851","English","J.

Accordingly, 22 patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia and 20 healthy community volunteers, all 23 to 45 years old, received magnetic resonance imaging scans. Seven axial magnetic resonance imaging sections of 5-mm thickness were segmented into cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter, and white matter compartments and used for volumetric quantification. For the healthy control subjects, age correlated significantly with the percentage of all magnetic resonance imaging sections taken up by gray matter but not white matter. After correcting for the normal effect of age, the schizophrenic group was found to have significantly less gray matter than the control group but no difference in white matter; ventricular volume was 34% greater in the schizophrenic group. The schizophrenic group had less gray matter in all six cortical subregions analyzed; these differences attained statistical significance for all but the parietal measure. These findings have implications for studies of localized gray matter abnormalities and suggest that regional brain volume measurements need to be expressed in the context of possible widespread gray matter volume deficits in schizophrenia. © 1992, American Medical Association.

Our objective was to develop and evaluate a fully automated method to estimate cerebral volume from magnetic resonance images (MRI) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, MRI data from 17 normal subjects and 68 untreated MS patients was used to test the method. Each MRI volume was corrected for image intensity non-uniformity, intensity normalized, brain masked and tissue classified. The classification results were used to compute a normalized metric of cerebral volume based on the Brain to IntraCranial Capacity Ratio (BICCR). This paper shows that the computation of BICCR using automated techniques provides a highly reproducible measurement of relative brain tissue volume that eliminates the need for precise repositioning. Initial results indicate that the measure is both robust and precise enough to monitor MS patients over time to estimate brain atrophy. In addition, brain atrophy may yield a more sensitive endpoint for treatment trials in MS and possibly for other neuro-degenerative diseases such as Huntington’s or Alzheimer’s disease. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.","","Automation; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Tissue; Automated estimation; Automated techniques; Classification results; Degenerative disease; Image intensities; Magnetic resonance images (MRI); Multiple sclerosis; Non-uniformities; Brain","","Insana M.F.; University of California, Biomedical Engineering, One Shields Avenue, Davis, 95616, CA; Leahy R.M.; University of Southern California, Signal and Image Processing Institute, 3740 McClintock Avenue, Los Angeles, 90089-2564, CA","Springer Verlag","03029743","3540422455; 978-354042245-7","","","English","Lect.

The aim of the present study was to investigate neuropsychological functions in dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) with respect to morphological changes that were revealed by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods. Twenty patients with DAT (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) and 10 healthy age and sex matched controls were included. The neuropsychological function was evaluated on a test battery covering the severity of dementia, verbal and visual memory, concentration and attention, language skills and general intelligence as well as activities of daily living. 3D MRI sequences were acquired using a 1.5 T Siemens MAGNETOM. Whole brain volume, total intracranial volume (TIV), volume of the frontal and temporal lobes and volumes of the amygdala-hippocampus complex (AHC) were assessed using the newly developed software NMRWin. Results. Apart from TIV all morphometric parameters differed significantly between the diagnostic groups. AHC volumes discriminated best between the groups, with only a small overlap. AHC atrophy exceeded generalized atrophy. These findings were confirmed when the data were reanalysed after dividing the DAT patients into a mildly and moderately affected group. The severity of dementia was significantly correlated with the volumes of the AHC and the volumes of the temporal lobes bilaterally, but not with the whole brain volume and the volumes of the frontal lobes. Conclusions. These results underline the important role of the temporal substructures for aetiology and progression of DAT. They indicate that the volume of the AHC can be monitored by MRI and may be used to follow up the disease process.","","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Analysis of Variance; Atrophy; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Disease Progression; Female; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Limbic System; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Severity of Illness Index; Temporal Lobe; aged; alzheimer disease; article; atrophy; attention; brain size; clinical article; computer program; controlled study; daily life activity; disease course; female; frontal lobe; human; intelligence; language; male; neuropsychological test; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quantitative diagnosis; temporal lobe; verbal memory; visual memory","","","","00332917","","PSMDC","9122303","English","PSYCHOL.

Quantitative anatomic brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of a subgroup of children with psychotic disorder not otherwise specified were compared with those of children with childhood-onset schizophrenia and healthy comparison subjects. Method: Anatomic MRIs were obtained for 71 patients (44 with childhood-onset schizophrenia and 27 with psychotic disorder not otherwise specified) and 106 healthy volunteers. Most patients had been treated with neuroleptics. Volumetric measurements for the cerebrum, anterior frontal region, lateral ventricles, corpus callosum, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and midsagittal thalamic area were obtained. Results: Patients had a smaller total cerebral volume than healthy comparison subjects. Analysis of covariance for total cerebral volume and age found that lateral ventricles were larger in both patient groups than in healthy comparison subjects and that schizophrenia patients had a smaller midsagittal thalamic area than both subjects with psychotic disorder not otherwise specified and healthy comparison subjects. Conclusions: Pediatric patients with psychotic disorder not otherwise specified showed a pattern of brain volumes similar to those found in childhood-onset schizophrenia. Neither group showed a decrease in volumes of temporal lobe structures. Prospective longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging and clinical follow-up studies of both groups are currently underway to further validate the distinction between these two disorders.","","Adolescent; Age Factors; Age of Onset; Analysis of Variance; Brain; Child; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia; neuroleptic agent; adolescent; adult; article; brain size; caudate nucleus; child; controlled study; corpus callosum; device; female; frontal lobe; globus pallidus; hemispheric dominance; human; lateral brain ventricle; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; psychosis; putamen; temporal lobe; thalamus","J.L.

To assess continuity with brain abnormalities in the later onset disorder and to further localize brain maldevelopment, this structure was examined in a unique sample of childhood onset schizophrenics. Anatomic brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired for 25 patients (mean age 13.9 ± 2.1) who had onset of schizophrenia by age 12 (mean age at onset 9.9 ± 1.9) and 55 normal children. The midsagittal area of the corpus callosum was divided into seven sections. With no adjustment for brain volume, no diagnostic differences were observed. After adjustment for the smaller cerebral volume of the schizophrenics, larger total, anterior and posterior corpus callosum areas emerged for the schizophrenics. These findings provide further evidence for continuity between childhood onset and later onset schizophrenia and support other studies showing white matter sparing in the context of decreased cortical volume.","gray matter; midsagittal; neurodevelopment; white matter","Adolescent; Age of Onset; Child; Corpus Callosum; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Schizophrenia; adolescent; article; brain development; childhood; clinical article; controlled study; corpus callosum; female; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; onset age; priority journal; quantitative diagnosis; schizophrenia","","","","09254927","","PSREE","9104755","English","PSYCHIATRY RES.

Whole brain volume, CSF volume, volume of the frontal and temporal lobes and the volume of the amygdala-hippocampus complex were assessed using the software NMRWin. Compared to the controls, depressed patients showed a significantly lower whole brain volume and a significantly higher CSF volume, whereas volumes of the frontal and temporal lobes as well as the amygdala-hippocampus complex volumes were not significantly decreased. In addition, depressed patients exhibited a higher ventricle-brain ratio suggesting a higher degree of central atrophy compared to healthy individuals. In contrast, Alzheimer patients showed significantly lower volumes than depressed patients and controls with respect to all volumetric parameters. Although the findings indicate the presence of brain atrophy in patients with late-onset depression, the pattern of volumetric changes in these patients differs markedly from that observed in patients with primary degenerative dementia.","Alzheimer's disease; late-onset depression; MR-volumetry","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Amygdala; Atrophy; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Ventricles; Delirium, Dementia, Amnestic, Cognitive Disorders; Dementia; Depressive Disorder; Female; Frontal Lobe; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Parietal Lobe; Reference Values; aged; amygdaloid nucleus; article; brain atrophy; clinical article; controlled study; dementia; depression; female; frontal lobe; gerontopsychiatry; hippocampus; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; quantitative diagnosis; temporal lobe","","","","01650327","","JADID","9089060","English","J.

The medial temporal lobes have been proposed as possible locations for such a lesion. The authors tested this hypothesis in a group of children and adolescents with childhood-onset schizophrenia who had severe, chronic symptoms and who were refractory to treatment with typical neuroleptics. Method: Anatomic brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired with a 1.5-T scanner for 21 patients (mean age=14.6 years, SD=2.1) who had onset of schizophrenia by age 12 (mean age at onset=10.2, SD=1.5) and 41 normal children. Volumes of the temporal lobe, superior temporal gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus were measured by manually outlining these structures on contiguous 2-mm thick coronal slices. Results: Patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia had significantly smaller cerebral volumes. With no adjustment for brain volume, no diagnostic differences were observed for any temporal lobe structure. Unexpectedly, with adjustment for total cerebral volume, larger volumes of the superior temporal gyrus and its posterior segment and a trend toward larger temporal lobe volume emerged for the patients with schizophrenia. These patients lacked the normal (right-greater-than-left) hippocampal asymmetry. Conclusions: These findings do not indicate a more severe medial temporal lobe lesion as the basis of very early onset of schizophrenia.","","adult; article; brain development; brain size; clinical article; clinical feature; early diagnosis; female; human; hypothesis; image analysis; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; psychosis; schizophrenia; school child; temporal lobe","","","American Psychiatric Association","0002953X","","AJPSA","8610822","English","AM.

These changes may reflect an anomaly of brain development. Brain structure was assessed on a 1.5-Tesla MRI scan in a series of 29 adolescents at the time of a first episode of schizophrenia and compared with 15 adolescents with other serious psychiatric disturbance (mostly psychotic) and 20 normal adolescent controls. The age at scan ranged between 13 and 20 years. In the adolescents with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, total brain volume increased with age in a way that differed significantly ( p=0.007) from that seen in patients with other psychiatric disturbance and normal controls. Thus, brain growth, as assessed by this index, had reached a plateau in the control group by the age of 13 years, but this was not true of patients with schizophrenia. The measure that most clearly distinguished the groups ( p<0.001 after co-varying for height and sex) was the volume of the left lateral ventricle - the ventricle was significantly larger in patients with schizophrenic illness, and ventricular size increased with age to a greater extent in the patient group, although not significantly so, than in normal controls. Thus, aspects of brain growth are delayed in patients with early onset schizophrenia, and the greatest severity of illness is reflected in a component of growth that is lateralized to the dominant hemisphere. Individuals who develop serious psychiatric illness, including schizophrenia, represent a fraction of the population in whom a component of the relative development of the cerebral hemispheres occurs late.

METHODS: The IUD measured from the axial MR scans of 17 healthy control subjects was correlated with the volume of the amygdala hippocampal complex obtained from coronal MR images. The IUD was also measured on axial MR scans in 12 patients with possible or probable Alzheimer disease. RESULTS: The correlation between the total amygdala hippocampal volume and the IUD was insignificant for control subjects (r = -0.38, P = .13). When analysis of covariance was performed with the IUD as the dependent variable and age and diagnosis as the independent variables, overall R2 was 0.25. Age (F = 5.02, df = 1, P = .034), but not diagnosis (F = 0.02, df = 2, P = .88), had a significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: The IUD has no significant correlation with the amygdala hippocampal volume. The IUD appears to be a better measure of overall brain volume, which changes with age. In our patient population diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease, the IUD measurement was not found to be useful in distinguishing their scans from those of the volunteers.","","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Female; Hippocampus; Human; Male; Middle Age; Reference Values; adult; aged; alzheimer disease; amygdaloid nucleus; article; brain atrophy; brain size; clinical article; controlled study; correlation function; covariance; female; hippocampus; human; male; measurement; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging","","","","01956108","","AAJND","8352163","English","AM.

Subjects were 32 adults with DS. Basal ganglia volumes from 22 of these subjects were compared with those of 22 cognitively-normal individuals, who were individually matched on age, sex, and race. Performance on neuropsychological tests was correlated with basal ganglia volumes for 32 individuals with DS, and basal ganglia volumes of five demented DS subjects were compared with those of 14 non- demented DS subjects. Results indicated larger putamen volumes in the DS subjects, despite significantly smaller total brain volumes. Volumes of caudate and globus pallidus did not differ between DS and control subjects. Although there were some significant correlations between basal ganglia volumes and age, neuropsychological test performance, and dementia status in the DS subjects, these associations appeared to be a reflection of neurodevelopmental or atrophic reductions in overall brain volume rather than a reflection of specific basal ganglia abnormality. Correlations between age and volumes of basal ganglia and total brain were not significantly greater in non-demented DS subjects than in control subjects. Results suggest that volume reductions of the basal ganglia are not a salient feature of aging or of the dementia associated with DS.","Aging; Basal ganglia; Dementia; Down syndrome; MRI; Neuroimaging","Adult; Age Factors; Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Basal Ganglia; Brain Mapping; Dementia; Diagnosis, Differential; Down Syndrome; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Reference Values; adult; aging; article; basal ganglion; brain size; caudate nucleus; clinical article; down syndrome; female; human; male; mental task; neuropsychological test; priority journal; task performance","","","","09254927","","PSREE","9204510","English","PSYCHIATRY RES.

Method: Coregistered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography scans were obtained in 27 schizophrenic patients, 13 patients with schizotypal personality disorder, and 32 control subjects who performed a serial verbal learning test during tracer uptake. After thalamus edges were outlined on 1.2-mm MRI scans, a radial warping program yielded significance probability mapping in three dimensions. Results: Significance probability mapping (with resampling) identified an area in the region of the mediodorsal nucleus bilaterally with significantly lower relative metabolism in the schizophrenia group than in either the control or schizotypal personality disorder groups, which did not differ from each other. The three groups did not differ significantly in total thalamic volume in square millimeters or thalamic volume relative to brain volume. Shape analyses revealed that schizophrenic patients had significantly fewer pixels in the left anterior region, whereas patients with schizotypal personality disorder had significantly fewer pixels in the region of the right mediodorsal nucleus than did control subjects. Conclusions: Schizophrenic patients showed significant metabolism and shape differences from control subjects in selective subregions of the thalamus, whereas patients with schizotypal personality disorder showed only a difference in shape. Because the mediodorsal and anterior nuclei have different connections with limbic and prefrontal structures, the anterior thalamic shrinkage and mediodorsal metabolic and shape changes might relate to the different clinical pictures in schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia.","","Adult; Brain; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory; Schizophrenia; Schizotypal Personality Disorder; Thalamic Nuclei; Thalamus; Tomography, Emission-Computed; Verbal Learning; adult; article; brain function; brain mapping; brain metabolism; brain size; clinical article; female; human; learning test; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; personality disorder; positron emission tomography; priority journal; schizophrenia; task performance; thalamus","E.A.

In addition, the relationship between APOE-ε4 genotype and volumetric indices was examined. Method: MRI-based volume measurements of the whole- brain, ventricles, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, hippocampus, and amygdala were acquired in elderly subjects with DLB (n = 27; mean age = 75.9 years), AD (n = 25; 77.2 years), VaD (n = 24; 76.9 years), and normal control subjects (n = 26; 76.2 years). Results: Subjects with DLB had significantly larger temporal lobe, hippocampal, and amygdala volumes than those with AD. No significant volumetric difference between subjects with DLB and VaD was observed. Compared with control subjects, ventricular volumes were increased in all patients with dementia, though those with DLB showed a relative preservation of whole-brain volume. There were no significant differences in frontal lobe volumes between the four groups. APOE-ε4 status was not associated with volumetric indices. Conclusion: The findings support the hypothesis that DLB is associated with a relative preservation of temporal lobe structures. In the differentiation of DLB and AD, this may have important implications for diagnosis.","Alzheimer's disease; Dementia with Lewy bodies; Frontal lobe; MRI; Temporal lobe; Vascular dementia","aged; Alzheimer disease; article; brain atrophy; brain size; brain ventricle; clinical article; controlled study; dementia; female; human; Lewy body; male; multiinfarct dementia; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; senile dementia; temporal lobe; volumetry","R.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements and the presence of highsignal lesions (HSL) were analysed in 31 patients with mild to moderate probable AD and 22 controls. In the AD group, MRI findings were compared with cognitive variables and specific features of memory functions. Alzheimer patients showed a significant reduction in volumetric measurement compared with controls in the total volume (P < 0.01), temporal lobe (P < 0.01) and amygdala (P < 0.05). The temporal lobe/brain volume ratio was also significantly reduced in AD subjects (P < 0.05). Atrophy of temporal structures was significantly related to the degree of episodic and semantic memory impairment according to a material-specific effect. No significant correlations between amygdala and cognitive variables were found. The results of our study confirm the usefulness of measures of temporal lobe atrophy assessed with MRI in the diagnosis of AD. In contrast, HSL are relatively common in AD patients (12/31 cases) and were not related to volumetric findings, severity of dementia or functional disability.","Alzheimer dementia; Amygdala; High signal lesions; Magnetic resonance imaging; Temporal lobe","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amygdala; Atrophy; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory Disorders; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Temporal Lobe; aged; alzheimer disease; amnesia; amygdaloid nucleus; article; brain atrophy; brain size; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; disease severity; early diagnosis; female; functional disease; human; male; memory; morphology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; temporal lobe; volumetry","","","","03405354","","JNRYA","9747916","English","J.

Method: Frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and whole brain volumes were obtained from magnetic resonance images of 91 patients with schizophrenia (54 men and 37 women) and 114 healthy comparison subjects (62 men and 52 women). Four independent symptom scales, based on the following symptom clusters, were derived from clinical data; negative, disorganization, Schneiderian hallucinations- delusions, and suspicion-hostility. Regression analyses incorporating the four clinical scales and neuroanatomical volumes were performed to investigate possible interactions between brain region and sex. Results: Significant interactive effects of sex and frontal lobe volume were found in regression analyses of the disorganization and suspicion-hostility symptom scales. In men, higher frontal lobe volume was associated with milder severity of disorganization but was not correlated with severity of suspicion-hostility. In women, higher frontal lobe volume was associated with more severe disorganization as well as more severe suspicion-hostility. No associations were found between brain volume and severity of negative or Schneiderian symptoms. Conclusions: Differences between male and female patients were observed in the relationships between frontal lobe volume and two of the four clinical dimensions examined. These findings suggest that aspects of the neuropathological basis for some symptoms of schizophrenia may be sexually dimorphic.","","adult; article; brain region; brain size; clinical feature; controlled study; demography; female; human; image analysis; major clinical study; male; neuroanatomy; neuropathology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; psychiatric diagnosis; rating scale; schizophrenia; sex difference","","","American Psychiatric Association","0002953X","","AJPSA","","English","AM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The magnitude and extent of cortical atrophy were evaluated with MR hemispheric surface display and volumeric measurement in three groups: 17 patients with corticobasal degeneration, 17 matched patients with Alzheimer disease, and 17 matched healthy control subjects. RESULTS: The extent and magnitude of cortical atrophy were larger in the group with corticobasal degeneration than in the group with Alzheimer disease. The parasagittal and paracentral regions were significantly more atrophic in patients with corticobasal degeneration than in patients with Alzheimer disease (P < .05). The mean hemispheric-to-total intracranial volume ratios were significantly smaller in the patients with corticobasal degeneration (61%) and those with Alzheimer disease (64%) than in control subjects (69%). Asymmetry of hemispheric volume was significantly larger in the group corticobasal degeneration than in the control group. CONCLUSION: The extent of cortical atrophy in corticobasal degeneration is more widespread than was previously thought. Parasagittal and paracentral atrophy is a distinctive feature of corticobasal degeneration and distinguishes it from Alzheimer disease.","Alzheimer disease; Brain PET; Brain, atrophy; Brain, MR; Brain, SPECT; Brain, volume; Dementia; Magnetic resonance (MR), image processing; Magnetic resonance (MR), three-dimensional; Magnetic resonance (MR), volume measurement","article; brain atrophy; clinical article; controlled study; corticobasal degeneration; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic value; differential diagnosis; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal","H.

We sought to determine whether adult relatives without psychosis or schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses might also have structural brain abnormalities, particularly in subcortical regions found to be impaired in patients with schizophrenia itself. Subjects were six sisters of schizophrenic patients and eleven normal female controls. Sixty contiguous 3 mm coronal, T1-weighted 3D magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the entire brain were acquired on a 1.5 Tesla magnet. Cortical and subcortical gray and white matter was segmented using a semiautomated intensity contour mapping algorithm. Volumes were adjusted for total brain volumes. Adjusted gray matter subcortical volumes were significantly smaller in relatives than in controls in total hippocampus, right amygdala, right putamen, left thalamus, and brainstem. Relatives had significantly enlarged left and total inferior lateral ventricles. These results, though preliminary, suggest that some never-psychotic relatives of schizophrenic patients have abnormal brain structure. If replicated in a larger sample including both sexes, these results would suggest that the genetic liability to schizophrenia is also expressed as structural brain abnormalities.","Brain; Genetics; MRI; Schizophrenia; Siblings","Adolescent; Adult; Brain; Cerebral Ventricles; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Nuclear Family; Personality Tests; Pilot Projects; Schizophrenia; article; autopsy; brain size; clinical article; controlled study; event related potential; eye movement; female; human; human cell; human tissue; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; schizophrenia; sibling; structure analysis","L.J.

Late paraphrenia is recognised as a heterogeneous disorder. This is reflected by the division of such patients into schizophrenia and delusional disorder in ICD-10. Earlier imaging studies have suggested that major structural abnormalities may be associated with the onset of psychosis in later life. Method. Fifty late paraphrenics and 35 age-matched healthy controls underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging of the whole brain in the coronal plane. Measurements were made of intracranial and brain volumes and the volumes of the intracerebral and extracerebral cerebrospinal fluid spaces. Results. No differences in intracranial, brain or extracerebral cerebrospinal fluid volumes between patients and controls were found. Late paraphrenic patients had greater lateral and third ventricle volumes than controls and the left lateral ventricle was larger than the right. When the patients were divided into appropriate ICD-10 diagnoses: paranoid schizophrenia (n = 31) and delusional disorder (n = 16), lateral ventricle volumes in the delusional disorder patients were much greater than those of the schizophrenics and almost twice those of controls. Conclusions. Structural brain differences underly diagnostic heterogeneity within late paraphrenia. The brains of late onset schizophrenics are only subtly different from those of healthy elderly individuals.","","adult; article; brain ventricle; clinical article; controlled study; delusion; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; schizophrenia","","","Royal College of Psychiatrists","00071250","","BJPYA","7804661","English","BR.

Temporal and posterior frontal brain volumes were quantified from MRIs in a cross-sectional study of 31 male and female patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and 29 age- and sex-matched healthy comparison subjects. Mean scores on the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMS) were in the mild range for the DAT group (20 ± 6.6), but patients with moderate and severe dementia were also included (MMS range of entire DAT group = 4-28). Significant mean differences in frontal and temporal lobe brain volumes were found between the DAT group and the age- and sex-matched healthy comparison group, but the sensitivity of any single measure was limited to 87% with a specificity of 83%. Initial multivariate discriminant analysis revealed significant gender differences among the healthy subjects, but not the DAT patients. The large group size allowed for subsequent discriminant analyses to be performed by gender. All healthy subjects and DAT patients were correctly classified by gender-specific discriminant functions. The male discriminant function variables included brain volume, age, and temporal lobe measures. Inclusion of age in the male discriminant function accounted for age-related brain atrophy, a finding that may have emerged as a consequence of the broad age range of the male DAT population (50-81 years). The male discriminant function was also successfully applied to an independent group of mildly demented subjects that included patients for whom the diagnosis of dementia was uncertain but verified by follow-up clinical evaluations. Measures of temporal lobe brain matter and temporal lobe cerebrospinal fluid volumes were the significant discriminator variables for the women. Quantitative MRI and multivariate discriminant analysis showed promise in distinguishing the dementing process from healthy aging in a group of 60 subjects. Moreover, while not diagnostic of DAT, the approach appeared to offer additional information about the probability of a diagnosis being later confirmed in patients with very mild dementia for whom the clinical identification of DAT is uncertain. © 1995.","Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Brain volume; Gender differences; Magnetic resonance imaging; Temporal lobe","Adult; Aged; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Comparative Study; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Human; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Age; Sex Factors; Temporal Lobe; adult; aged; alzheimer disease; article; brain atrophy; clinical article; controlled study; dementia; discriminant analysis; female; frontal lobe; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; quantitative diagnosis; temporal lobe","C.

To elucidate the relationship between reduced cognitive function and cerebral metabolism in patients with AD, we hypothesized that the absolute amount of glucose used by the entire brain may prove to be a more reliable indicator of the disease than metabolic rates calculated for a unit of brain weight. Twenty patients with the probable diagnosis of AD and 17 similarly aged controls underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) studies as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within a few days of each other. Average metabolic rates, when corrected for atrophy, were 3.91 ± 1.02 and 4.43 ± 0.87 (mg of glucose per 100 cc brain tissue per min ± s.d.) respectively for AD patients and controls. Two other indices were determined, atrophy weighted total brain metabolism (calculated by multiplying the brain volume, determined by MR analysis, by the average metabolic rate) and absolute whole brain metabolism (calculated by multiplying the brain volume by the average metabolic rate corrected for atrophy). The former showed a very significant difference between the two groups (29.96 ± 7.90 for AD patients compared to 39.1 ± 7.0 for controls, p < 0.001). Atrophy weighted total brain metabolism also correlated very well with mini mental status exam (MMSE) scores (r = 0.59, p < 0.01). Absolute whole brain metabolism was significantly different between AD and control groups and correlated well with MMSE. These data demonstrate that although the metabolic rate per unit weight of the brain is unchanged in AD compared to controls, atrophy weighted total brain metabolism and absolute whole brain metabolism are significantly affected. Both indices may prove to be a sensitive correlate for cognitive dysfunction in AD.","","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Brain; Deoxyglucose; Female; Fludeoxyglucose F 18; Glucose; Human; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Age; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Tomography, Emission-Computed; adult; aged; aging; alzheimer disease; article; brain atrophy; brain metabolism; brain size; clinical article; cognitive defect; controlled study; female; human; male; metabolic rate; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; priority journal","","","","01615505","","JNMEA","8410281","English","J.

It therefore lends itself to investigation of developmental deviance in the early onset of schizophrenia. Method: Using stereological methods, the authors obtained bilateral measurements of the superior temporal gyrus (total, gray matter, and white matter volumes) from 40 adolescents with recentonset schizophrenia and an equal number of matched healthy volunteers. Symptoms were rated by using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Results: The total and gray matter volume of the right superior temporal gyrus was significantly lower in patients with early-onset schizophrenia than in the healthy volunteers, even after differences in whole brain volume were controlled. Bilateral superior temporal gyrus volumes were positively correlated with the age at onset of psychosis, while severity of thought disorder and hallucinations were inversely related to right superior temporal gyrus volume. Conclusions: In patients with early-onset schizophrenia, the predominantly right-sided volumetric abnormalities found in the superior temporal gyrus may reflect a particularly early neurodevelopmental disruption. The relationship between language-related symptoms and superior temporal gyrus volume is similar to that seen in adult-onset cases but not as lateralized.","","Adolescent; Age Factors; Age of Onset; Antipsychotic Agents; Brain; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Functional Laterality; Hallucinations; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Temporal Lobe; adolescent; adult; article; brain size; clinical article; controlled study; correlation function; female; gray matter; hallucination; hemispheric dominance; human; male; nerve cell differentiation; onset age; pathogenesis; priority journal; schizophrenia; temporal lobe","S.

Individuals received an MRI at baseline and a clinical and cognitive evaluation at baseline and follow-up. By using the baseline MRI we assessed the anatomical subdivisions of the temporal lobe: anteromedial temporal lobe (hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus), medial occipitotemporal (fusiform) gyrus, middle and inferior temporal gyri, and superior temporal gyrus. We studied two groups of carefully screened age- and education-matched elderly individuals: 26 normal elderly (NL) and 20 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Fourteen individuals (12 from the MCI group and two from the NL group) declined to DAT within the 3.2-year follow-up interval. We used logistic regression analyses to ascertain whether the baseline brain volumes were useful predictors of decline to DAT at follow-up after accounting for age, gender, individual differences in brain size, and other variables known to predict DAT. After accounting for age, gender, and head size, adding the volume of the anteromedial temporal lobe (the aggregate of hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus) and an index of global atrophy raised the accuracy of overall classification to 80.4%. However, the ability to detect those individuals who declined (sensitivity) was low at 57%. When baseline medial occipitotemporal and the combined middle and inferior temporal gyri were added to the logistic model, the overall classification accuracy reached 95.6% and, most importantly, the sensitivity rose to 92.8%. These data indicate that the medial occipitotemporal and the combined middle and inferior temporal gyri may be the first temporal lobe neocortical sites affected in AD; atrophy in these areas may herald the presence of future AD among nondemented individuals. No other clinical baseline variables examined predicted decline with sensitivities above 71%. The apolipoprotein APOE ε4 genotype was not associated with decline.
